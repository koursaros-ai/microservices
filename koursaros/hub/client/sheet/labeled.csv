❤ Instagram worthy view! Luxury High-rise Downtown,"We have had an incredible trip! Rod’s apartment was perfect. His description and photos of the apartment painted an incredible picture and it still exceeded our expectations. The location couldn’t have been better as we were just a few steps from public transportation and a market for groceries was right at the corner. 

Even when we came inside to escape the rain, we had a spectacular view of the city.  The whole building was super clean, comfortable, stylish, and safe. Rod was always super quick to respond to any questions we had and gave us great recommendations for local restaurants. We would love to stay here again next time we’re in Chicago.",Chicago,0
❤ Instagram worthy view! Luxury High-rise Downtown,"Just like everyone else said, the view is spectacular. This apt is sparkling clean and breathtakingly beautiful. I was in Chicago for a work meeting and loved coming back in the evenings to this comfortable, homely, beautiful apt. I had no trouble getting in each time.. the women at the front desk were all friendly (I made a point of saying hello to each of them so they were greeting me like old friends after 2 days). It's close to everything - small market just 200 feet away allowed me to stock the fridge. I highly recommend Rod and his lovely apt.",Chicago,0
2 Bedroom Upstairs Apartment Parking $10/ Day,"Grace’s place is sparkling clean. Even on barefoot you wouldn’t feel dust on your feet. The place is so stylish and I love the simple touches on every part of her house. It is a great value for money being a 2bedroom and can also accommodate more people with the 2sofabeds in the living room. The kitchen is complete with stove, oven, microwave, fridge, cooking ware and utensils. The place is very close to grocery store, some resto and the Belmont Blue station. This is such a great place and I will definitely stay again when i go back to Chicago.",Chicago,0
2BR Bursting w/ Character in Hip Logan Square!,I love love love Danielle's place.  It's extremely charming and well decorated. You can definitely tell she put a lot of effort into all the details of the apartment. It was perfect for a winter visit to Chicago with the amazing fireplace and heated floors. The walkways and stairs were kept clear of snow and salted. We even heard a snow blower once or twice ;). There was always parking available on the street right outside the house. Which was a major plus for us. The neighborhood was great. Plenty of places to eat and bars to check out. I would highly recommend staying here and will likely book it again.,Chicago,0
2BR Bursting w/ Character in Hip Logan Square!,"Danielle’s space was perfect for our trip to Chicago. There were four of us, so we did two in each bed — totally comfortable. As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.",Chicago,0
Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park,"Heather and JP are wonderful hosts!! Their space is incredibly stylish and really unique. We loved the garden area and enjoyed sitting outside to eat breakfast and relax. It is in an amazing location, within walking distance of so many great restaurants! We really appreciated their flexibility with check-in and all the special touches that were included. This is one of the best Airbnb's that we've ever stayed in! We'll definitely stay here again whenever we're in Chicago. If this place is open, then book it. You'll love it! ",Chicago,0
Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park,"One of our favorite AirBnB locations ever!   Hip, comfortable and in a great location.    Heather and JP have thought of everything you will need to enjoy your stay.   We loved the privacy of the location.  It was so hip and stylish, as well as super comfy.   Felt like home.   You are only a 5-7 min walk to the L.  Bus transport is easily accessible.  As well, the neighborhood is very cool.   It is close to many other fun areas of west Chicago.  Not far from downtown either.   We didn’t even find a need to go to the magnificent mile.   There is too much fun to be had hanging out in this area of town.   We did go to Logan’s Square a bit.  It’s very close.   Loads of good bars and food.   
We would definitely stay here again.   They have set a high bar for what to expect for future stays with AirBnB!!  ",Chicago,0
Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park,"We had a great stay at Heather and JP’s. Our schedule was a bit in flux but they were very accommodating to our changing arrival time. 

The space itself is really a hidden gem tucked away behind a lovely garden for privacy and quiet. The loft was so unique and charming and they did a great job to maximize the space. It’s very functional but stylish. Just a note to be careful on the steps approaching the bed/loft area and to watch your head as it’s a bit of a low clearance. 

We had an easy time street parking our car directly outside the unit which was extremely convenient and one less thing to have to worry about. We also appreciated the easy self check-in/out process. 

The location was convenient to exploring some really cool shops, bars, and restaurants nearby. It was a great way to experience some local flavor outside of the more touristy stuff. 

Thanks for a great visit! ",Chicago,0
Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park,"My sister and I absolutely loved staying at Heather and JP's place. This was our first time booking an Airbnb and the bar is set really high for any future bookings anywhere else. The location is great. The loft is beautifully decorated, very cozy and very clean. The complimentary snacks were also a very nice touch. Our friends that were staying at a different Airbnb stopped by for a few minutes and they were upset they didnt book this first. This place is truly charming. If we're ever in Chicago we hope we can stay here again. Thanks Heather & JP for being such great hosts and providing everything one would need for a perfect stay.",Chicago,0
"Bright, Modern Apartment in a Vintage Greystone","This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy.
The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",Chicago,0
"Bright, Modern Apartment in a Vintage Greystone",We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,Chicago,0
"Charming, Spacious 1BR Studio in Belmont Cragin","Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",Chicago,0
Cozy Coach House,"We had a lovely stay here and would come back in a heartbeat! Scott was so welcoming and responsive, and very thoughtful about making sure that we had everything we needed. The coach house is bright and spacious, tidy, and had plenty of amenities -- from toiletries to an iron to fresh eggs in the fridge. The neighborhood is peaceful, with easy access to public transit and some great cafes and restaurants nearby (try brunch at m. henry!) A perfect launchpad for exploring Chicago, or for taking some time to rest and relax.",Chicago,0
Enjoy Chicago’s Nightlife from Studio Apartment,"Nala's place is a nice, cozy space. It is super close to public transportation, a post office, salons, a boutique, some tasty eateries and murals. It is about a 30 minute ride on the train to the city center, which isn't bad at all. There is a bar below that can play music until 5am and some patrons that hang outside to smoke for a little. If you are a super light sleeper, this is not the place for you. The noise did not bother me one bit and Nala provides white noise machines just in case the noise is a bit bothersome. The bed is super comfortable and the kitchenette is great for heating up some food or making something small. Nala is also helpful and communicates with you in you in advance of your trip so all is well. Overall, I loved the style, location, and convenience of Nala's studio.  Nala is a great host; I would love to stay here again!",Chicago,0
Enjoy Chicago’s Nightlife from Studio Apartment,"Nala's place is absolutely perfect. We felt like one of the locals in this studio apartment, and we both already decided we're keeping this in mind for our next trip!

Some great points:
- Decor is adorable. Especially loved the bamboo shades to block out the street lamps.
- Amenities are spot on. Coffee, shampoo, you name it. 
- Area is great. Close to public transport and found free street parking close by. We also loved having the 7-Eleven right below us!
- Speaking of businesses below, don't worry about the noise from the pub. It was plenty muffled, and if you still find yourself struggling to sleep, there's the white noise machine!",Chicago,0
Entire place with free parking.,"We stayed for 5 days, and had a very enjoyable stay. Jose was very friendly and answered any questions quickly. He gave us restaurant recommendations, which definitely made our stay better! You can hear his family walking in the apartment upstairs, but that is the nature of apartment living, and did not detract at all from the loveliness of the apartment. The driveway to park in was a definite bonus, it helped us save money by driving in instead of flying. It's nearby public transportation, so we left our car in the driveway and avoided having to pay for parking all week. We would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in Chicago once more.",Chicago,0
Entire place with free parking.,"Staying at Jose’s was magnificent. The apartment is very clean, stylish & perfect for a getaway! Jose accommodated my family in every way possible, from letting us check in early, drove us to our event we were in town for & gave great suggestions of places to visit, eat & easiest ways to get around Chicago. I would definitely recommend his place to family, friends & anyone else looking to visit the city. It’s within perfect distance of downtown and major attraction areas but also far enough away to where it is quiet & relaxing. The neighborhood itself is very family oriented and I loved having his driveway to park in, made life a lot easier! We will definitely be back!",Chicago,0
Entire place with free parking.,We really enjoyed our stay at Jose's. It is very clean and the space itself is very comfortable. We especially loved the bed and duvet which are super comfy and the bathroom is great. It takes about 45 mins to get into downtown but there are transport links close by and Jose is very helpful and offered to give us a few rides to the nearby metro station. There are lots of restaurants and shops in the area and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Some reviewers and Jose himself mentioned that he and his family live above the apartment but we barely heard them to be honest. Excellent value for money!,Chicago,0
Explore Chicago from an Urban Sanctuary with Free Parking,"This place is wonderful!  It may be a studio but you won’t feel like it is.  The decor is definitely done by a professional (or someone with great style).  I’m taking some ideas home with me to spruce up my decor!  The location at first I thought was in a gritty neighborhood but it turned out nice, there’s a grocery store just a block away too which is nice.   Downtown Chicago is about a 45-55 minute Uber ride during the week.  Also the host was great and I love that they texted instead of called!",Chicago,0
Explore Logan Square from Renovated Condo with Free Parking,"Came into Chicago during the worst of the snow storm this year, and Leo & Alex's home was everything we could ask for and more! Lizbeth, who manages the rental responded to all of my texts immediately and was very attentive to our needs. Location/neighborhood is superb as we were within 10-15 mins drive of trendy restaurants and bars.. Home space was very trendy and cozy, which was great for hanging out when the storm was heavy, and beds were probably the most comfortable I've slept on in all of my stays on Airbnb. I would absolutely love to stay here again whenever back in Chicago.

Just note that if the snow is ever really bad during your stay, that it can be a bit difficult to get in/out of the parking area.. Factor in extra time to dig out and defrost your car and driveway, which from a Californian, wasn't as bad it seemed...",Chicago,0
Explore Logan Square from Renovated Condo with Free Parking,"The apartment was lovely and the beds were very comfortable. I was traveling with 3 younger girls (12, 11, and 11) and I loved that the location was near plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, and parks. The area is definitely a mix of lower to mid income residents and students. With plenty of funky, high end, hipster spots. We felt very safe walking the neighborhood. And we had plenty of room in the space to spread out! The biggest plus was the free parking. Leo and Alex were gracious enough to allow us to use the lot a bit early, before check in, and a bit later, after check out. All things were accessible by Uber in 5 minutes or so. ~20 Uber ride to downtown. I would definitely give this spot another visit and recommend it to others.",Chicago,0
Explore Logan Square from Renovated Condo with Free Parking,Our family enjoyed the space. The check-in process was easy. The photos and description are accurate. The house was very clean. It’s very nice that it has a private parking space. The parking is at the back and there is a narrow pathway next to the house where you can walk from  the parking lot to the front door.    This can be a bit inconvenient if you are carrying many luggage. We love the kitchen and dinning area where we cooked breakfast and heated up leftovers. The only thing is the air condition was quite loud. But we don’t get too much noise in the bedrooms.,Chicago,0
Foodie Paradise in Logan Square area - Sunny 1 BDR,"This one bedroom apartment is an Air BnBer’s dream.  We have stayed in Air BnBs around the world and this is among the best.  
Clearly, the home’s owner thought through everything that a guest might need.  We arrived to find coffee and tea waiting, which was perfect after a long day of travel.  
The apartment is clean, spacious, well located and very, very comfortable.  It is the best Ikea styling I have ever seen in real life. In fact, Ikea would do well to stage a photo shoot here.  The furniture, the decoration, the artwork are all simple, yet we felt like we could move right in and live here as a forever home. 
•	The bed is like a cozy nest (loved the pillows).  
•	The kitchen (and the fridge in particular) were sparkling clean.  It was stocked with more than the basics, which was great since we always shop for breakfast food when we arrive in a new city, and found a Trader Joe’s quite nearby.
•	There is a little office with many kinds of connectors for phones and computers
•	The living room couch is really comfortable, and there’s a lap blanket for cuddling up.  
•	The bathroom was outfitted with much more than we needed.  The towels were soft and fluffy and there were plenty of them.
•	The lights and heat are controlled by a Nest system with sensors to turn lights come on and off as you enter and leave a room.  That no doubt helps with the energy use but it takes a little human adjustment  We ended up taping over the bathroom light sensor so it didn’t blast on in the middle of the night when one of us wandered into the bathroom.
•	The building is on a busy main street, which concerned us as we arrived -- I am very sensitive to noise. But once inside, the apartment is completely quiet.  If the weather had been warm enough to open windows, it might have been noisier, but we didn’t test it out.  
•	Street parking is a little competitive and cars have to be moved off the street in the later afternoon when the parking lane becomes a traffic lane.  This was not an issue for us since we were gone pretty much all day long. 
Everything was as it was presented by Natalia, who was a thoughtful and attentive hostess.  We were in town to help our daughter move into an apartment walking distance from the Air BnB.  We hope to stay here again on return visits.",Chicago,0
Great location. Free parking.,"This is a wonderfully convenient, artsy and comfortable place to stay. Spotless, well appointed, really great bed, and amazing art work everywhere! Ewa is immediately responsive and provides a lovely and thorough welcome. As far as location, Wicker park is cool -  we found two awesome restaurants within walking distance and chose to eat nearby.  Getting to and from downtown is easy and  parking is free and easy.  I hope to stay here again next time I go to Chicago, and I highly recommend it for other Airbnb'ers.",Chicago,0
Great location.,"Ewa is a warm and courteous host, and her apartment is a lovely private space in the back of a cool art gallery. The apartment is thoughtfully stocked with all the essentials for a short stay (comfy bed, extra blankets, TV, toiletries, coffee/tea, plates and cutlery), and Ewa was responsive and easy to communicate with. The location is conveniently close to the blue line and a short Uber ride to some of the best parts of the city. We only stayed for one night but would have been happy to stay for longer!",Chicago,0
Great location.,"My friend and I took a lyft to the place and it was easy to find. We were able to check in and out quickly. The place was very clean and spacious with many amenities available to us including a fridge stocked with water and other things like a hair dryer, slippers, and hygiene products which was very thoughtful. We loved that we could control the AC since I get cold very easily and the area was very quiet. Ewa always responded quickly and was very helpful in providing transportation options. We were also able to leave our luggage with her for the day after we checked out which saved us from carrying it around through the city. Great stay overall!",Chicago,0
Great location.,"Ewa’s place in Chicago was perfect! The private parking lot in the back was a major plus and the area was very safe and trendy with lots of shops and restaurants up Milwuakee Ave. Ewa provided many different amenities when we checked in and lots of useful local tips. The room itself was decorated nicely and had VERY high ceilings which I loved. Even though the apartment was on a busy street, no outside noise could be heard from inside the apartment. Overall great experience and would definitely come back again!! Thank you Ewa!",Chicago,0
Great location.,"Ewa and her place are both wonderful! Ewa met us outside when we arrived to show us where to park and gave us a short tour of the rooms. Very comfortable, stylish, clean apartment. Bed is particularly cozy and we loved reclining in the leather chairs. Small snacks (chips, granola bars) were unexpected and very welcome - we were running late for an event when we arrived and weren't sure we'd be able to eat dinner that night. Easy walk to the L and more food. Highly recommend, you'll be happy here.",Chicago,0
Great location.,"Ewa was such a wonderful host! Her home was lovely, so clean and had nice touches. There was coffee and tea as well as a few snacks. Apparently the main heat wasn’t working, but I couldn’t even tell. Ewa had placed a space heater in the bedroom and the fire place in the living room gave off good heat. So it was nice and cozy despite the blizzard that was happening outside. 

Ewa also gave me quite a few suggestions about things in the neighborhood to do, places to eat, and how to get around. This was also at 10pm when I arrived. I appreciated that she took the time to check me in even though it was late. 

I ended up not having to stay both nights I booked. Ewa was kind enough to refund the second night even though I let her know it wasn’t necessary. I would definitely stay here again.",Chicago,0
Joe's Place in West Portage Park,"This was my first time staying with a superhost, and Joe certainly lived up to the designation. We got in late and he was kind, helpful, and communicated promptly and clearly. The beds and linens were super comfortable, very nicely made. We had intended to leave earlier,but slept in till checkout because we were so comfy. Nice shower and spa tub with a skylight. I met Joe in the morning and he was a charming, lovely person..I really appreciated him making us so welcome. The location is good for access to downtown. We drove a few minutes, parked near the station, and caught a train that got us to the heart of the city in 30 minutes. I heartily recommend staying here, only wish we had for more than one night!",Chicago,0
Light Filled Loft Apartment near Downtown Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)

If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask. 

But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",Chicago,0
Light Filled Loft Apartment near Downtown Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",Chicago,0
Light Filled Loft Apartment near Downtown Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",Chicago,0
Light Filled Loft Apartment near Downtown Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",Chicago,0
"Luxury Chicago Loft, 1 blk to train w/ 2 pkg spots","We loved every minute of our stay at Elisa and Jay's loft. It was charmingly decorated, with all amenities of home and more.  Even more lovely and spacious than the photos are able to show. We took full advantage of all the neighborhood had to offer, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping and more using reference material provided by the hosts.  For longer distance trips, the train was so very close and we took full advantage of this perk exploring all the city has to offer. Check in and out was easy it was so thoughtful of the hosts to check in on us during our stay to make sure all was well.  Highly recommend. This is a major value accommodation. Thank you for sharing with us.",Chicago,0
Modern Chicago Loft with a Complimentary Garage Spot,"I really enjoyed my stay at Dasha & Owen's place.  I stayed two nights, while on business.  It was great to be able to prepare a meal and stay in and work one evening, rather than eat out.  There is a full set of spices, olive oil, and balsamic-- everything you need to enjoy a light meal.

A hair dryer, iron, shampoo/ conditioner/ body wash-- all were provided and were great for business travel.  I had an excellent night of sleep, as the bed in this unit is exceptionally comfortable.  I loved the modern finishes, and thought for value this loft is a real gem.  I will stay again in the future, while on business in the Chicagoland area.",Chicago,0
Modern Chicago Loft with a Complimentary Garage Spot,We love this place because it is absolutely gorgeous and stylish. My wife and I just got married and spent a few days in Chicago and we were glad to stay here for our mini-moon. Communication was also great from the start and it was clean. My only hesitation would be that it's pretty far from downtown around 30 minutes away and the bus in front took long but Uber was very easy and not as expensive as we thought it would be. We're planning to go to Chicago again and we will definitely hit up this place again when we do!,Chicago,0
Modern Room in the Heart of Loop,"Anne's place was great!  She let us drop off our bags a few hours early before her already already check-in which was great!  The check-in and check-out process was extremely easy.  The location was pretty good, about a 15-20 minute walk to River North area.  Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the main highway to get to the upper areas of the city.  Lyft rides were all about $5-$15 which was great!  Bed was comfortable, pillows were pretty flat but not terrible.  The place was very clean and I felt safe the entire time with a secure lock on our bedroom door.  In comparing the prices when looking at Chicago, this was by far the cheapest and despite it being a ""shared"" airbnb, it felt like a hotel (since we had an Ensuite) just a LOT cheaper!  Also about a 1 minute walk to Gino's which was my favorite of all the deep dish pizza that I tried in Chicago!   Also very conveniently located across the street from a 7/11 that was either open very late or 24/7!   We did not see Anne while we were there, however she was VERY quick to respond to any message I sent her and she was very friendly.  Thanks Anne for a lovely stay!!!",Chicago,0
"Modern, Open, Loft in Chicago's Logan Square","Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",Chicago,0
Perfect Location Downtown Apartment Great View,"Now I know why they call you a super host because your place was super cool! Also, thanks for giving us the opportunity to stay at your place while in Chicago. It was a good experience! Love how you had snacks available for us because I really do love snacks so that’s definitely a plus for as well as the other stuff available in the house like toilet paper, soap, shampoo and etc. Although, we had our own supplies it was just convenient knowing that the supplies were there if we needed it. Last, but not least the sky view of the place is absolutely breathtaking. How beautiful to wake up to and go to sleep to the beautiful view. If I’m ever in Chicago, I would most definitely book and recommend others to book at your place.",Chicago,0
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"Ken's place was clean & comfortable; it was within walking/ train distance of everything that we needed. It was truly cold in Chicago when we were there, and it was wonderful to have plenty of clean towels, sheets, and warm blankets. Parking and checkin were really easy, and Ken was easy to communicate with. We were a little surprised that he popped by to say 'hello' twice before 10 am on New Years Day (and we were rushed to get to our breakfast reservation), but it was good to speak with him. We'd love to stay again sometime.",Chicago,0
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"My husband and I have stayed at many Airbnb's, and this is by far our favorite! The locations is within minutes of walking from fantastic restaurants. The house of stocked with snacks, drinks, and even ramen! The washer and dryer was super helpful given we stayed for a week.  Ken was very responsive to any questions and inquiries, as well as helpful! The beds are very comfortable and the space was pretty quiet especially given such a central location.  If we are ever again in Chicago, we would love to come back!",Chicago,0
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"My family and I could not be happier with staying here. Not only was the coach house immaculate, but it was cozy, inviting, and full of thoughtful touches. The space was just right for our group, felt safe and private despite being in the city.  The location was easy to get to and close to everything. Super convenient. We loved the notes that were placed around the space, made everything really easy to locate and use. The entire set up really helped us feel like we were in a home away from home. Not to mention the beds were extremely comfortable! Would definitely love to stay here again if ever in the Chicago area. I can’t say enough great things about this place- top notch!!!!",Chicago,0
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"We were so incredibly lucky to find this place. This was a girls trip and none of us had ever been to Chicago before. We felt more than safe coming in and out of Ken & Curt’s coach house and felt safe knowing they were close by. We often find ourselves renting from hosts who own multiple properties and we rarely hear from them so I really loved that we were all on the same property as Ken and Curt. The space was clean, organized, and easy to find fully equipped with espresso pods and snacks. We would highly recommend this place and would love to stay again if we ever get the chance. Thank you guys again for having us!",Chicago,0
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"This is literally the best place we have ever stayed in! There was everything you could possibly need, the place was immaculate and the beds were the most comfortable ones I’ve slept in! Even better than mine at home! 
Ken and Kurt are the perfect hosts and such lovely people we really felt at home with them. 
The area felt safe and very close to walk to little Italy for some lovely food. 
The down side to our stay.... nothing at all! Other than we had to come home. Thank you Ken and Kurt we shall certainly come back to your place when we return!",Chicago,0
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"We had a great stay from first arriving thru to departing.

Check in is simple and easy to complete.

Arriving the place was lovely and warm, music on, snacks left out, bottled water, tea, coffee and basic supplies on hand which really made it feel like home. It was so exciting to have a nespresso machine and nice tea bags!

The bathroom was well stocked with shampoo, conditioner, soap and other basics.

The apartment was very clean with lovely quality towels that we nice and fluffy.

It had a book of local info which was helpful and was very conveniently location to restaurants and a few shops.

Unfortunately due to delayed luggage we lost some time and didn't get to explore as much as planned. Ken was very friendly and offered if we needed any additional supplies due to the lost luggage.

I would certainly come back and highly recommend to others.",Chicago,0
Relaxing Room in the Heart of the Loop,"Anne's apartment is a terrific value, and I would definitely stay there again (I've already recommended it to my sister, who's planning a trip). It's a lovely, spacious, beautifully decorated space in a great and safe location. Easy walk to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. and a short walk to two ""L"" (subway) lines. My only issues concerned the overall air system. It turned out that the bedroom windows didn't open and since there was no ceiling fan or central fan, it felt airless with the door closed. I'm someone who's used to sleeping with an open window. Once I asked Anne about it the following night, she had helpful suggestions that resolved the problem.",Chicago,0
Relaxing Room in the Heart of the Loop,"Location can’t be beat, right smack dab in Chicago. Lotsa restaurants and bars and little shops around. Quick few blocks walk to the parks- I walked from apt to Millennium Park in 18 mins, and even in January temperatures, it was a lovely walk. The apartment is cozy, I wanted a bit more heat and after texting to ask Anne, she said yes I can adjust the thermostat. The bed is comfy, no weird smells in the building or apartment. I had to put an air diffuser away in bathroom cabinets because it was strong for my sensitive nose but other than that it was perfect. Living room area is lovely and comfy too! The room had a good lock on the door so it really felt secure. Don’t hesitate to book this awesome place!",Chicago,0
SHARED Artist Loft . Very Unique,"From booking to check out, Michael was extremely accommodating and thorough. I love to stay in unique spaces and Michael’s space was perfect. The city centric location, proximity to a variety of bars, restaurants, stores and venues was ideal. Michael was a great host with a lot of knowledge and unique insight to his city and recommendations during our short stay. The room was delightfully comfortable we almost missed walking around the city! :) I would not hesitate staying here again especially to see the outdoor patio all planted. This truly felt like a home away from home.",Chicago,0
SHARED Artist Loft . Very Unique,"This was our first stay at an Airbnb, and we couldn't have been happier.  The location of his apartment is fantastic.  It's easy to get to and close to a lot of great restaurants.  He has a lovely terrace filled with flowers, which was a perfect place to relax.  His apartment is decorated with a lot of unique and fascinating items.   The bed was very comfortable.  Michael was proactive in communicating and very quick to reply to questions.  He also gave us some great recommendations for lesser-known sites to see in the city.",Chicago,0
SHARED Artist Loft . Very Unique,"Michael's loft is simply beautiful, clean and exactly as pictured. It is central and easy to walk to from the train. We found it easy to go around without needing to use the subway. Many tourist spots were just a 15-20 minute walk away and it was also close to the riverwalk. There are many good restaurants and bars near by, easily in a perfect location. Michael is a great and friendly host, I would definitely want to stay here again if I were to come back to Chicago. Thank you so much for sharing your loft with us and it was lovely to meet you!",Chicago,0
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"I had the perfect stay.

Michael is the most welcoming and friendly host. Check-In was super easy. He showed me the flat and gave recommendations when I arrived. The room is comfortable and the flat is located in the middle of Downtown Chicago, which makes is a good base to explore the city. The highlight, though, is the deck with the wonderful flower pots! I spent relaxing mornings and evenings there, had lovely chats with Michael and his other guests, and enjoyed this unique oasis in the middle of buzzing Chicago. 

You can tell Michael enjoys hosting and having people around in his home. If I come back to Chicago, I will happily stay there again :-)",Chicago,0
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"Michael is the kind of host I hope everyone gets to encounter through airbnb. He is perfectly welcoming, doesn't overlook details, and truly made my stay in Chicago special. I loved that I could drop my bags earlier in the day before check-in to go exploring sans-baggage. Same was true for the day of my check-out - Mike kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city. 

As for the space: it is stunning. My bed was extremely comfortable, in-room shower/vanity/toilet was great, plenty of outlets to charge your technology, I was lacking nothing. There was water with a few lemon slices waiting for me on the night stand - again no details were missed. 

Bottom line: Excellent value. Perfectly outfitted space with the charm and character that defines the ideal airbnb experience. If it's available during your stay, book it. ",Chicago,0
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"This place is PHENOMENAL!!! Words can't describe how lovely having a glass of wine on the patio in bloom is while surrounded by the incredible sights and sounds of the city! We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedrooms listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cute and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable beds. The amenities provided were out of control, anything you could possibly need is probably there for you (did you forget a toothbrush? razor? floss? not to worry! it's there!)! Definitely the best airbnb experience I have had to date and I hope we can stay there again! Thanks Michael!!",Chicago,0
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,I could go on and on about how much we loved staying here! Came up for a girls weekend and it was just what we needed. We were allowed to check in early when our flight got in. The loft is super eclectic but it is a working space!! If you are any sort of froo froo this is not the space for you but we loved the charm. The deck is gorgeous and it was the BEST location. We took one Uber the whole time we were there. Michael made sure we had everything we needed while we were there and we loved chatting with him! We were literally headed to the airport talking about when we were going to come back. Thank you again Michael!!,Chicago,0
Stunning Retro Apartment in Andersonville,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",Chicago,0
Stunning Retro Apartment in Andersonville,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.

This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",Chicago,0
Stunning Retro Apartment in Andersonville,"Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.",Chicago,0
Stunning Retro Apartment in Andersonville,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",Chicago,0
Stunning Retro Apartment in Andersonville,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay there again.",Chicago,0
Stunning Retro Apartment in Andersonville,"This place is lovely. It’s a very clean and well restored apartment.  The windows are about at ground level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground level.  We liked this, it felt cozy and being on the ground floor was very convenient. The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private. Took a few baths, nice bathroom. It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Clark street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!",Chicago,0
"Unwind in the Bath at a Hip, Historic Coach House","I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",Chicago,0
Urban Comfort in the Heart of Chicago,"Min's place was great! First of all, the location is just as nice in real life as the photos suggest. Very stylish, tidy, and roomy. The bed was so comfortable that my partner said they would like to marry it. I really loved the location. A two minute walk to the end of the block connects you to blocks and blocks of restaurants, bars, entertainment, and stores. There was no need to drive at all!

Min was very responsive and very quick to answer my questions. He helped us get parking, gave us a tour, and got us all settled. Perfect host. I will be back!",Chicago,0
Urban Comfort in the Heart of Chicago,"Min’s home is quaint, cozy, and equipped for even the coldest weekend in Chicago! We were greeted and welcomed by Min himself. He reviewed the check in procedures with us and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. You can expect a clean home with plenty of sleeping space, additional blankets, and towels. As a guest you have your own entrance, control of the thermostat, and a ton of storage. The space is used very well in this home and doesn’t leave you feeling cramped. Min’s home is located a few blocks from restaurants, bars, and some light shopping (Target, Trader Joe’s, TJ Maxx, Urban Outfitters). The train station is a short walk away from the home making it a convenient place to stay if you’re not wanting to be in the city. We felt incredibly safe and welcomed in Min’s home. He is fast to respond and assist with any questions you might have. I can not recommend this place enough!! Don’t miss out on a lovely stay here.",Chicago,0
Urban Comfort in the Heart of Chicago,"This was my second time staying at Min's unit, and I would have booked the entire weekend rather than just one night if there had been availability. I knew exactly what to expect since I had stayed in January, but Min did tell me about the recent changes (a new couch and bed). He even met me at my car and helped me with my luggage as well as my parking situation. I love this place and definitely would stay again – it's very conveniently located to El (train) and bus lines but is quiet and peaceful.",Chicago,0
"Walk to Shows, Dining & L from Flat in Art Deco Private Club","I loved this listing. From check-in to check-out, it was easy. The cafe downstairs was a great way to jumpstart our mornings. My boyfriend went to the gym downstairs, while I enjoyed the coziness of lounging around in the living room. There are many little restaurants within walking distance. The rooftop deck is worth checking out too. We went at night and the view was beautiful, especially with all the snow. 

My boyfriend and I had minimal interaction with the host, Aaron, but he’s easily accessible. Really nice guy and genuine when we spoke on our last day!",Chicago,0
"Walk to Shows, Dining & L from Flat in Art Deco Private Club",We absolutely loved this place! Aaron was such a great host! Everything was so clear as far as instructions and helpful tips. His place is so neat and very clean. All of the amenities were great and we loved the building. We truly felt like we knew the host even though we never met him just because of his hospitality. The place looked just like it did in the photos… So often you see pictures of a place and worry that it won’t look the same when you get there but that definitely was not the case at this place.,Chicago,0
"Walk to Shows, Dining & L from Flat in Art Deco Private Club","This was my boyfriend and I’s first Air Bnb experience and we loved it! This place was exactly as shown in the pictures! The check in was pretty simplistic (however try to avoid the neighbor with the angry dog). At first we struggled hard to find parking but Aaron’s instructions on parking are pretty clear and very helpful. The streets can be hard to find spots on so I recommend leaving your car somewhere if you get a spot and then taking advantage of the train and bus system which is very close to Aaron’s place and convenient! When you get into the hotel, I’d recommend checking out all of the extra amenities offered such as the pool and especially the rooftop deck. The bedroom was very nice and the kitchen, and living room as well but my favorite thing about the place was the bathroom (specifically how comfortable the shower is). Although, we had not met Aaron, he was always available when needed and was pretty clear with the instructions. Also, the apartment is near many places that you explore. I’d recommend Vietnamese town (tank noodles is always my #1 spot) and try not to park in 975 W Wilson Ave if you can’t find a parking spot, we booked it using SpotHero and had many complications. Overall, it was an unforgettable experience and we had a wonderful time! We will definitely book this place again if we visit Chicago!",Chicago,0
“Cozy Room” Private En Suite Bath & Breakfast,"Cozy Room 3 is exactly that - small and cozy and thoughtfully arranged, sparkly clean, and comfortable. I had an early flight and only spent one night there (barely) and I wish I would have had more time there to enjoy the home and neighborhood. I did take a nice long walk in the neighborhood, which was lovely. If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll definitely look into staying at Dan and Traci’s place and give myself more time to soak it in. Cozy Room 3 has everything - nice bathroom with shower, a Keurig coffee maker, a mini fridge, big fluffy soft towels, plenty of storage space, and a lock on the door. There were lots of nice touches and this had more of a bed and breakfast vibe to it. Thank you Dan and Traci! ",Oakland,0
“Cozy Room” Private En Suite Bath & Breakfast,"This place is absolutely amazing! I loved that each room had its very own name/style and that their ""Cozy Room"" definitely lived up to my expectations. Dan & Traci are also really great hosts! Dan gave my sister and I a full tour of the home and ensured that all concerns were covered, and Traci blessed us with a delicious, hearty breakfast each morning! (her Quiche is a must-try btw). Overall, my sister and I had a wonderful experience at their lovely home and would definitely recommend to you future travelers! <3",Oakland,0
"“Treetop"" Private Bedroom Bath w/ Breakfast","If you’re looking at this place, book it!!! The rooms are super cute. The house is adorable. The location is close enough to walk to the BART quickly. Everything was spotless and they have little labels on things so you know where to find anything you need. They have cute little touches to everything. The breakfast! It was wonderful and held us over until lunch. We took the bikes to Berkeley campus and enjoyed the ride. Dan and Traci are so friendly and nice and their hospitality is top notch. If you’re lucky enough to wake up to Traci doing her actual job and preparing food for her clients, the smell will make you want to eat everything up. We loved our stay here and will continue to tell people about it. ",Oakland,0
"“Treetop"" Private Bedroom Bath w/ Breakfast",I really enjoyed my stay at Dan & Traci's.  I was in town on business and the location was great for driving to Oakland and El Cerrito where I was working.  In the evenings I enjoyed being able to walk around the lovely neighborhood and to College Ave where there were lots of nice shops and restaurants.  A healthy and filling breakfast was much appreciated.  The room was small but had everything I needed and the bed was comfortable for a few nights.  Overall the house was great but I didn't spend much time in the common  areas save for the backyard which was very pleasant.,Oakland,0
A Farm in Berkeley,"I really enjoyed staying here - the room and garden were beautiful and a wonderful respite from urban Berkeley.  If you stay here, it'll likely take you a bit to adjust to the shower and water closet, if you're not used to that type of thing, but I thought it was really fun taking a shower in a greenhouse.  

It's worth mentioning that there's not a microwave or stove, so if you plan on cooking/warming leftovers, you may want to take that into account.  Sequoiah provided some excellent cow's milk that went great with my coffee.  In all, I loved staying here and would certainly do so again if the opportunity arose.",Oakland,0
A Farm in Berkeley,"I can’t say enough wonderful things about our stay at The Farm in Berkeley. The thoughtful touches that Sequoiah provided like the informational binder with places to try and the milk in the fridge helped make our stay so easy and effortless. The cottage was so quaint and perfectly decorated, and there are some social kitties who will chat with you in the garden if you like.   I only wish we could have stayed longer. If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway and to be surrounded by nature, look no further. Your peace of mind awaits. Thank you for a lovely stay, Sequoiah and company. We would love to visit again :)",Oakland,0
A Farm in Berkeley,"I just spent a couple of nights at Sequoiah's place and it was wonderful! The place is really beautiful, especially if you like nature and greenery--it is everywhere! It felt like a little oasis and escape from city feeling. The guest area is very private, from the room to the bathroom and shower. It is down a path and covered in greenery so it feels very much like it's own separate house. The outdoor bathroom is really clean and nice and showering in the green house was very special. Would love to come back next time I'm in Berkeley.",Oakland,0
A Farm in Berkeley,"Amazing getaway in the sunshine with so many happy plants! I loved this simple and serene space. We had a great experience; highlights include enjoying a cold beer in the sunshine at the picnic table and saving my outdoor showers for the afternoon when the sun was brightest. The location is great. Quiet and peaceful but a quick walk to Standard Fare (my new favorite) or to Highwire coffee to do some work remotely. The Wi-Fi at the farm is great too. Despite being designed as an open space, the layout of the farm is situated such that it felt really private.",Oakland,0
Boho-Chic Inspired Guesthouse Studio Loft,"I needed a place to stay while I was in Oakland for a few days, and this was the perfect spot. I love how secluded the studio is; there are beautiful plants and trees surrounding it. The furniture is super comfortable, and the amenities  shocked me. I had everything I needed. I was particularly shocked and happy about all the cooking supplies that were available to me. The popular dinner/bar spot “MUA” is only a 6 minute drive away. There are plenty of outlets around the studio, and the different lighting options are a plus. I didn’t want to leave! It’s obviously that Jesus puts time and thought into his studio. THANK YOU!",Oakland,0
Boho-Chic Inspired Guesthouse Studio Loft,"Oh my goodness, I wanted to stay forever!! I was in town for work and this place was such a cozy, quiet refuge to return to at night. It’s a beautiful space; unique style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. Jesus was incredibly accommodating when I asked if I could arrive early and very quick to respond to messages. The place is only about a 10 minute walk from the BART station. I appreciated that Roku was set up on the TV, too. Very, very comfy couch and bed. The wine and snacks were a lovely touch. Yummy coffee and ample dishes and supplies. Thank you!!!",Oakland,0
Boho-Chic Inspired Guesthouse Studio Loft,"Jesus's place was lovely. Everything was clean, functional, and well thought-out. The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. Also, it does get a little bit warmer when you're sleeping that high up so I had to turn up the AC during the night. All-in-all, we really enjoyed our stay. We didn't get to meet Jesus in person but we met his son who graciously helped us with late-night check-in. Both were very kind and professional, we felt like we were in good hands :) hope to be back in the future!",Oakland,0
Bridges View Aparment w/2 Parking spots & Laundry,"Marianne's place was very nice and comfortable  A clean and modern place with all the amenities need it for our days in the area. 

 The kitchen has everything you need to cook when needed it, it has a blender! That's a plus for me ,because I really enjoy my breakfast smoothies .  The bed and the sofa-bed are high quality and super comfortable. 
We used our son's car and there is parking right in front of the house, on a low traffic road. 
The views from every window are breathtaking , it's very easy to fall in love with this place ,from the location to the wonderful accomodations . Thank you Marianne for welcoming us to a little place in heaven .",Oakland,0
Bridges View Aparment w/2 Parking spots & Laundry,"This space is beautiful and private.  The bed is very comfortable.  There is a coffee maker and cable TV.  Marianne has thought ahead to make the rooms welcoming and comfortable, well-stocked with anything you might need for your stay.  There is a little market within walking distance with a lovely coffee shop (I love coffee - big bonus for us).  Everyone we ran into was very friendly.  We did not have our own vehicle.  If you are not used to driving in hills, be advised that this area is quite hilly and the roads are narrow - so do take your time getting in and out of the neighborhood.",Oakland,0
Bridges View Aparment w/2 Parking spots & Laundry,Location was perfect. We loved the scenic views and appreciated the quiet residential area after our long days of exploring the city. The place is nicer than the pictures. Very clean with great amenities that made our stay relaxing and comfortable. We love coffee so having that readily available was the best perk. The bed is extremely cozy and comfortable. Having access to a washer and dryer was also extremely helpful. We were headed to San Diego for the next part of our trip and needed a quick laundry fix. Marianne is by far the best Airbnb host. She was very responsive and helpful the entire time. We highly recommend staying at her place and look forward to staying there again on our next visit.,Oakland,0
"Bright cozy room, lovely apartment","I highly recommend staying with Laura! She is so lovely and hospitable, as was her precious dog Sassy. Her home was always tidy and quiet. The description she provides of the home is very accurate. What you read is what you get... and more!! Laura made it feel like my own home. I cooked in the kitchen and did laundry while I was there. The location is great too because it is only a short uber/taxi to Oakland or San Francisco  (or you can take the ferry!) If you are considering staying with Laura, do it! You won't regret it.",Oakland,0
"Bright cozy room, lovely apartment","Laura is such a incredible host. She is so lovely and friendly everyday. She helped us with everything she can. The house is small but cozy. You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. There is all you need in kitchen, bathroom, living room bedroom. The way to the next bus stop to Oakland is like 10 minutes away, that's good. From there you can go with the Bart to San Francisco.  Everything was really really nice her! We would come back to Laura. Thank you !!",Oakland,0
Charming 100 year old California bungalow,"Very highly recommended! I have stayed in lots of Airbnb’s and this is one of the best. The hosts thought of everything and really added the perfect touches to make this place feel like a home away from home. We stayed for five days and were very comfortable. Little things like a bed warmer (!), extra toiletries if you forgot something, and even scissors (sounds silly but I needed one and was glad to find one!) are afterthoughts in many Airbnb’s. We loved staying here and will recommended to anyone we know traveling through the Bay Area.",Oakland,0
Charming 100 year old California bungalow,"We had a really great stay! The place is spacious and well-appointed and had everything we needed for our family of three. The apartment was very private and quiet. Most of all, we loved meeting Ralph & Laura. They are lovely, kind people and we look forward to seeing them again. We were in town visiting friends and this was the perfect location for us. You can also walk to Laurel shopping district for a bite to eat and other shopping needs. One note: This place is best for a couple or small family, as you have to walk through one bedroom to get to the other.",Oakland,0
Charming 100 year old California bungalow,"This was our first major stop after a long flight from Australia and we couldn’t have felt more at home!

The accommodation is in a great location, close to shops and attractions and in a safe and secure part of Oakland.

The accommodation is fantastic for families (we hav (Website hidden by Airbnb) year old). The whole bottom floor of Laura and Ralph’s house and their large garden was ample space for us, and was private. The amenities are of a great quality and we had everything we needed.

There were many thoughtful touches from our hosts as well such as a baby bath, toys, home-made banana bread and tourist info. Laura and Ralph are lovely people and made us all feel welcome.

I would not hesitate to recommend this listing.",Oakland,0
Charming cozy and bright apartment,"We realy enjoyed our stay at Sierra's lovely home. Her home was in a great location where we felt very safe. The cleanliness of her home was impecable, and the beds, and pillows were super comfortable providing for a great nights sleep. My kids loved that the tv had a Roku stick. They wereable to watch some of their favorite tv shows :) The shower had really nice water pressure. We loved the overall brightness, and the windows gave a pleasant glow to wake up to in the morning. Best of all was the attention to detail. We really felt welcomed, and at home. There we several nice touches like having ice cubes, Perrier water, filtered water, coffee, and tea waiting for us. Sierra even give us some suggestions of events that were happening close by and things that we can do with our family. The only regret that we have is not being able to stay more days at her lovely home. Hopefully we can do that again in the future.",Oakland,0
Charming cozy and bright apartment,"We absolutely loved our stay at Sierra's little cozy apartment. It was decorated nicely and had everything we needed included a Lara bar that was needed for my post surgery wooziness. (I was in town for a surgery) We ended up needing to come a couple days early and Sierra was able to accommodate us and was so attentive to our needs. Check in was seamless, street parking was easy to find right in front of the place which is great for the Bay Area. Anytime I asked a question she got back to me right away! The place was spotless which is very important to me, it is what I look for the most in Airbnb reviews and this place did not disappoint. Very clean! Lots of closet space to hang coats and cardigans. Roku TV was a plus so I could veg out and watch some TV and catch up on some shows. The full kitchen was perfect for my husband to make me some chicken soup for my post operative recovery. Will definitely be staying here again in the future as we come to Oakland to visit friends often.",Oakland,0
Charming cozy and bright apartment,"We absolutely loved staying at Sierra's place! My two friends and I were attending Kamala Harris' campaign launch rally in Oakland and this was the perfect place to stay for the weekend. We arrived a bit earlier than expected and my phone failed to send the ETA message to Sierra but she let us drop our things off and freshen up which was deeply appreciated. We Lyfted to San Francisco which was a bit pricey but upon discussion with our driver found out we probably should've taken the public transportation. Despite that decision, we loved the location. It was quiet and had plenty of street parking. The apartment itself was cutely decorated and very homey. Plenty of towels, blankets, and sheets. The radiator heaters were a nice reminder of home (the East Coast). And the bed...I had the most restful sleep I've had in months! We were bummed to be only staying for the weekend and definitely will be back. Thanks Sierra!",Oakland,0
Charming private studio in prime location,"We enjoyed our stay w Ron and Laurie.  The location was perfect—just steps away from the Fourth Ave Strip. The evening we arrived Laurie drove us on a brief tour of the area to point where (and where not) to eat. The space was clean and efficient. It is clear to see they love their home and community. When we were planning our exploration of San Fran, Ron and Lauri visited our space, drawing maps, suggesting favorite restaurants. It was sweet.  We were especially touched when Ron met us outside to say goodbye while Uber was picking us up at 5 am.",Oakland,0
Charming private studio in prime location,"This place was so lovely! I’m a Cal alum visiting from the East Coast who wanted a space close to great food but a more quiet and restful area than those immediately next to campus. This spot was perfect! It was close to all of the delicious food and shops on 4th St, fairly close to campus but was nestled in a beautiful neighborhood with ample parking. The space was well-decorated and pristine. I loved the modern touches mixed with the historic elements of the home. Ron and Laurie were very warm and communicative throughout the stay and truly thought of every amenity we might need. I would definitely stay there again if I was ever in town.",Oakland,0
Charming private studio in prime location,We had the most wonderful stay at Ron & Laurie’s guesthouse. They are the warmest of hosts and made us feel so welcome. The space itself is lovely and airy with everything sparking clean and clearly labelled. They have really thought of everything their guests might need. They had complied an incredibly extensive guest book for local tips and offered lots of delicious restaurant suggestions. There is also some fresh coffee and homemade granola to enjoy along with other thoughtful touches. The only thing to bear in mind is for light sleepers as there are some loud trains nearby and quite a lot of light coming in. But they kindly provide earplugs so if you bring an eye mask you’ll be all set! I would definitely stay with them again. Thank you!,Oakland,0
Charming private studio in prime location,"Ron and Laurie are excellent hosts, and their historic home is at the heart of everything! The charming back studio apartment opens to a lovely private  garden from a separate side entrance. I enjoyed sunbathing and decompressing there. Laurie’s granola was outstanding and Ron’s conversation was much appreciated—I learned about their home because I inquired and he was gracious about telling me. From the apt I walked all the way home from UCal Berkeley and the Botanical Garden, which is probably only for people who love to walk as I do. I also walked easily over to Cesar Chavez Park and the Marina. Otherwise, you can take Uber or Lyft or public transport via 511.org to get where you want to be, or walk a block and a half to the cute shops and restaurants along 4th Avenue. I loved exploring Berkeley and Ron and Laurie’s home was the perfect base from which to do so.",Oakland,0
Charming private studio in prime location,"Ron & Laurie are amazing hosts! They let me drop off my bags early before check-in so I could get to wear I was going on time, and offered to hold onto them after I left so I didn't have to carry them around all day before my evening flight. They provided me everything I could have asked for, including the most amazing coffee (and cream and sugar) and tea and cookies. They even checked in with me throughout my stay to see if there was anything I needed, or if they could pick up anything at Whole Foods for me while they were out. I felt very taken care of! The room is spacious and so pleasing to the eye. The bed is incredibly comfortable - like nothing I've ever had at a hotel or AirBnB ever, and the comforter was lush and cozy. Lots of pillows in varying levels of firmness...just the best sleep experience possible. (They even provided ear plugs, as there is a train nearby that tended to wake me up early.) Plenty of space to stretch out and put your stuff. The bathroom is lovely, with a huge deep soaking tub for baths, a shower with some serious water pressure, and lovely succulents in the window. There's a beautiful seating area by the window which looks out onto the garden, which is the most beautiful way to start your day, write in your journal and drink your morning coffee. There's lots of automatic lights that turn on so you're never in the dark (as you walk up the driveway in the evening, or even into the bathroom!) And lots of locks and safety measures, so if you're staying alone as I was, you feel secure.",Oakland,0
Charming private studio in prime location,"This is a lovely apartment and Ron and Laurie are very accommodating hosts.  The apartment is within a short walk of a number of restaurants and shops and Laurie's suggestions for restaurants were great.  In fact we had one of the best meals while we were in the SF/Berkeley area at Luca Cucina, which is a short walk from the apt.  It is convenient to a BART stop - either a walk or short Uber ride - that makes it easy to travel to downtown or the Airport.  I would heartily recommend staying here.",Oakland,0
Charming private studio in prime location,"We loved staying here in Berkeley. The space is really nice. It’s light, very well equipped and has a lovely little seating area looking out at a sweet garden. Laurie met us personally and was lovely. She had thought of everything and gave really good advice about travel and places to eat. We stayed here hoping to explore San Francisco which we were able to do, one day we went by car and the other by BART which both worked well. However, the real surprise was the lovely shops just a tiny walk away which we just loved! We could have spent all our time just there! Overall it was a great stay.",Oakland,0
Charming private studio in prime location,"Walk into a beautiful,  peaceful private setting when you stay with Laurie and Ron. Everything has been considered regarding the comfort of their guests. The spacious room looks out over a lovely private brick garden courtyard, a peaceful setting for contemplation, reading, getting away from the craziness of the outside world. Your privacy is respected, yet they remain available if you need anthing. I appreciated the tall, locked gated entry into my area, added a feeling of security. (I just asked my husband to read this and he said it sounds fake. I promise, it isn't!)",Oakland,0
Chic and Cozy Studio Oasis in Oakland,"Was rly grateful that sandy and Kristine stayed up late and let us check in abt 10+ pm as we were stucked in a jam. They were so welcoming & offered us boiled water  as well. They even left us an umbrella outside our cottage as on that day it was expected to rain. That’s rly sweet. There’s a few restaurants nearby which offers decent brunch & dinner. Am in love with the vintage store at telegaraph Ave (walkable distance) opposite aunt Mary’s restaurant. However, if you’re driving to San Franscisco, expect the travelling time to b about 45mins. If a train is about 40mins too.. but I prefer Oakland to San Fran, cos it’s much more peaceful and u have almost everything in Oakland. Thanks sandy n Kristine once again, their Two doggies were rly tame and cute as well!",Oakland,0
Chic and Cozy Studio Oasis in Oakland,"This space was such a great oasis in the midst of the Oakland. So close to our relatives place, this space is very chic with some thoughtful touches and a relaxed vibe. They have a mini fridge for your needs that they so generously filled with some fluid treats. 
They were very communicative hosts and we appreciated their extra help with check in as we arrived hours later than expected. 
They have 2 sweet pooches who are out on the shared patio at times. Was nice because we needed some pet therapy! 
The bathroom has a great shower, good water pressure, loved both the mirrors and the well thought out positioning. There is a privacy curtain for the sliding door/window entrance so don't worry about any exposure. 
Overall, nice folks, nice place, nice area, nice time.
We had a blast in the bay area to wrap up our honeymoon and we will definitely be reccomending this spot to others.",Oakland,0
Chic and Cozy Studio Oasis in Oakland,"We had a lovely stay at Sandy's place! The check-in process was super easy. The room was super clean and decorated so beautifully! The bed was very comfortable for 2 people, and my husband especially enjoyed the mini fridge stocked with refreshments :) The shared backyard space was also really well styled and we enjoyed sitting on the deck drinking coffee in the mornings. We had lots of privacy and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. We were able to walk to a whole bunch of great restaurants and bars easily- this place is located in great area of Oakland!",Oakland,0
"Chic European Style Guest Suite, #2","What a great stay. Ben and Michael's place is so pretty and clean and comfortable. We love old houses and it was a great quaint bungalow. We slept extremely well in the very quiet bedroom in unit 2. Note that the bathroom is quite narrow and the unit is up a flight of stairs. Neighborhood felt safe and we had no trouble finding parking on the street or very nearby. The provided Keurig coffee and small bottle of milk, fruit & little snacks were much appreciated. I'd be very pleased to stay there again. Great, congenial, and helpful host.",Oakland,0
"Chic European Style Guest Suite, #2","This place is like your home away from home.  It was immaculately clean, very comfortable and beautifully decorated.  The guys very sweetly put out fruit, granola bars, yogurt, milk  and coffee. There even were freezer packs in the freezer.  They gave us a selection of maps and Ben gave us some great suggestions and detailed directions for day trips, public transportation, restaurants etc.  The lovely courtyard with fish pond and plants is spectacular and the on site laundry much appreciated.  The location was particularly close to family for us, but we were also close to public transportation, loved walking to the many nearby shops and restaurants and found parking to be no problem.  Mike and Ben were very attentive to our needs and have become good friends. We hope to stay here every time we're in the neighborhood.",Oakland,0
"Chic European Style Guest Suite, #2","The suite was very clean, they had thought of everyone a guest may need. When we checked in, Ben greeted us and gave us an extensive orientation. It was great! We learned a lot and was able to prioritize our activities. 

We loved being able to “escape” the hussle and bustle of San Francisco. This house is very quiet and the streets are clean and have a peaceful feeling to them. 

The bed is comfortable, the shower is small but we didn’t need anything extravagant. Everything was clean, and the welcoming fruit and milk was appreciated. 

We would stay here again and will suggest this place to anyone! My husband and I loved it!! If you are debating booking here, do it!!! You won’t regret it. 

Thank you for making our anniversary trip, our first bnb experience and first visit to San Francisco a great rememberable one!!",Oakland,0
"Chic European Style Guest Suite, #2","Michael and Ben were fantastic hosts right from when we booked several months ago. Ben greeted us warmly when we arrived, and took time to show us maps of the area and explain about public transportation and local amenities. 

The space is small, but very functional and well laid out, and also tastefully decorated. There are motion sensor lights at front door and at top of stairs, which makes it feel safe and also very functional. 

The house is beautiful and the immediate neighbourhood is safe and clean, but unfortunately you don't have to travel far to find a lot of litter, vagrants and discomfort. Travelling from the house to bus to BART is no problem, but the area of 40th and San Pablo (local grocery store) had a host of unsavoury characters. Target is a much cleaner, safer option.

In all, the hospitality that Ben and Mike showed us really outshone everything else. They are genuinely lovely people who make a great effort for their guests, and I can't imagine anyone leaving their place feeling otherwise. Thanks again!",Oakland,0
"Chic European Style Guest Suite, #3","I stayed here with a friend during a short stint in SF for a conference.  It's a lovely apartment with all the amenities you would need to enjoy your stay. The place is clean, comfortable and very charming. The location was perfect, and the surrounding area is very walkable and safe. Though I did drive into downtown SF (which was pretty straightforward), you can take transit which is easily accessible from the home. Michael and Ben are great hosts - great response rate during check-in. I would definitely stay here again.",Oakland,0
"Chic European Style Guest Suite, #3",This was our second visit to Ben and  Michael's place.  We loved it last time and it was just as good this time.  Both Ben and Michael are great hosts. The B&B is completely self contained and has everything needed for a comfortable stay.    It is only twenty-five minutes in the F bus across the bay to the centre of San Francisco.  Also within a ten minute walk there are shops for anything  that is required.  We arrived late afternoon and really appreciated that there was coffee and tea plus milk and some breakfast items supplied.  We would highly recommend Ben and Michael's B&B as a place to stay.,Oakland,0
"Chic European Style Guest Suite, #3","We loved our stay at Michael  & Ben’s place.  They are consummate hosts and offered many helpful suggestions for exploring the area.  They have books maps and guides available as well.  The apartment is a cosy upper level with stylish bedroom, intimate living room with small kitchenette with microwave and small refrigerator.  The place was beautiful had a lot of natural light and comfortable ambiance.  It was in a good location with easy access to San francisco and points north. Rudy’s cafe, a popular local eatery is across the street at the corner of the block.  We highly recommend Micheal & Ben’s place.",Oakland,0
Colorful Garden Flat five minute walk from BART,"What a magical space! We were so very comfortable and felt so welcomed. Every part of this little studio has a special touch from handmade curtains and down bedding. We arrived to a fresh baguette on the counter and milk in the fridge for our coffee. 
The studio could not be more centrally located with Bart just down the street, Oakland to the south and Berkeley to the north. A lot of coffee shops, restaurants and parks surround this neighborhood. 
We had such a lovely stay and would love to come back.",Oakland,0
Colorful Garden Flat five minute walk from BART,"This is a gorgeous space, decorated with creative flair. It’s very close to the BART station, so it’s very accessible, but it feels like an oasis of calm.  Everything you could need is provided and all the cupboards are clearly labelled. We appreciated the breakfast provisions in the fridge. Most of all, we loved chatting to Jenny and Mark on the morning we left. They are extremely cool! Jenny even gave us a lift to the car hire centre as we were leaving to go hiking in Yosemite the next day. Although we only stayed for one night, it was a really memorable one. Thank you!",Oakland,0
Colorful Garden Flat five minute walk from BART,"Jenny’s place was amazing. I walked in and immediately got a comfortable vibe and relaxing feeling as I entered the door. It has such fun style and great layout for solo or couples traveling. Great amenities and comfortable comfortable bed and couch to relax on. My girlfriend and I had just come off a week long bike ride/camping/party trip with the company work for through Napa Valley. We were in need of some quite time and relaxing. It was so nice to walk to Berkeley Bowl for grocery and then come back, make dinner, share a bottle of wine and watch a movie before turning in for the night. Jenny and Mark are lovely and so kind. I highly recommend staying here if your in the East Bay Area.",Oakland,0
Colorful Garden Flat five minute walk from BART,"I had an excellent stay at Jenny’s place. The house was very easy to locate and is situated on a quiet residential street with restaurants, coffee shops, and public transit just a few blocks away. The studio was perfectly clean and well-stocked with kitchen & bathroom amenities, linens & towels, and just about anything one might need to feel at home.  Also- I cannot overstate how wonderful it was to have a parking spot! Overall, the space exceeded my expectations with many thoughtful details throughout that make it inviting and comfortable. The online pics don’t quite do it justice. Jenny was easy to communicate with and answered all of my inquiries right away. Unfortunately I didn’t get to meet Jenny in person, but I would definitely love to stay here again next time I’m in Oakland.",Oakland,0
Colorful Garden Flat five minute walk from BART,"We are absolutely charmed by Jenny & Mark's wonderful unit. The best Airbnb we had stayed so far! We loved everything here, from your hospitality, attention to details, the unit location that is few minutes walk to Ashby bart station, the extra personal touch like complimentary basic food for guests,...... the list goes on.

Both me and my wife love the way you decorated your unit and its cleanliness. We love to use  your kitchen too. Thank you for making us feel so at home that we have to leave with heavy heart after staying for 5 days. I hope we a chance to visit you and Mark again in SF.",Oakland,0
Comfortable Private Cottage w/ Updated Living Area,"This is definitely a rare gem to find because it really is a beautiful cottage. It was truly an amazing spot and we would definitely recommend her place to any of our friends and family looking for a place to stay in the bay. She truly respected and valued our privacy during our stay. We love the thought she put into everything down to the tiny little things such as the snacks, the local eats, and even the extra blankets and pillows. 5/5 stars. The cottage is best if just 2 people. Perfect size for a young couple’s getaway.",Oakland,0
Comfortable Private Cottage w/ Updated Living Area,"From the second I saw the description of this home I was really drawn toward how beautiful it looked. I sent an email to Nina and she responded super quick and gladly welcomed us to stay at her home. I booked it right away without any issues. 
Nina reached out to me right after and asked if we had any special requests and said she wanted to make our stay as comfortable as possible which is such a nice gesture.
She gave us the information needed to get to the house and how to enter without any issues. The home is located in the back yard of her home and she’s always very easy to contact if any issues. It is truly a tiny home but it is so perfectly set up and has everything you need, the way it is built is amazing. You have all your necessities for a short trip. You will be amazed at the beautiful craftsmanship and design of this home. It can perfectly fit up to 3 people. It also has one of coolest showers I’ve ever seen In a home. The home is located in a nice quiet residential area and there is plenty of street car parking for those renting a car. There some amazing places to eat close by and Nina also has a list of some amazing places to have breakfast, lunch and dinner. Definitely check out Standard Fare for breakfast and lunch. Nina checked up on us a few times to make sure everything was going well which we loved. She and her family are such amazing people and made our stay a memorable one. Also this home isn’t far from San Francisco it was a quick 15-20 minute drive. You will not be disappointed. We cannot thank Nina enough for her amazing hospitality and kindness. I will definitely look to stay here again when I visit hopefully soon.",Oakland,0
Comfortable Private Cottage w/ Updated Living Area,"Nina’s tiny home is making me re-evaluate my life choices. Maybe I need to downsize my large 4-bedroom home, into a tiny home? I love how spacious everything is, and how comfortable and modern the loft and bathrooms are inside. The collection of Kerrigan coffee and teas were such a nice touch, and even the sparkling assorted sodas in the refrigerator was a nice surprise. There’s an organic market within 5 minutes of walking, and I was able to buy coconut creamer and other items. Nina’s tiny home is most certainly one of my “go to” places now, and I can’t wait for my next visit!",Oakland,0
"East Bay Studio Oasis - Rest, Relax, Or See It All","This suite was..  sweet! The place was just lovely! Probably my best experience yet. The lockbox was an excellent idea, I’ve never seen anything like that before. It made checking in a breeze. The backyard was so pretty as well as scenic. The room was comfy & tastefully decorated, tv was just the perfect size & my most favorite part was the beautiful shower & bathroom area. The lighting within the entire suite were just perfect. Felt like the perfect snug little home away from home. Thank you again so much for your hospitality.. looking forward to our next stay. :D",Oakland,0
"East Bay Studio Oasis - Rest, Relax, Or See It All","Perfect stay! The room is lovely with any possible amenities included, local guides, plays for children.
The best airbnb house ever had. We feel like in our home, warmly recommended.
The house is 10min walking from a but street with nice bars, shops and restaurants. Train station for San Francisco is not very close by foot but if you travel in 2 or 3 Uber is cheap and convenient if avoiding rush hours. Oakland and Berkeley offers ad well many interesting places to discover.
Definitely the best place we could find in the area, if we could ine day come back, for sure will come again here!",Oakland,0
"East Bay Studio Oasis - Rest, Relax, Or See It All","If you are looking for a quiet and lovely place to station yourself while visiting the East Bay, this is it. The place is newly remodeled in an eloquent and modern style, has a very comfortable queen-sized bed, small kitchen, and nice bathroom with probably the best shower I've ever had. The owners have lovingly seen to every detail of the place, from providing coffee and tea (and a jar of jelly beans!) to mouthwash (nice touch!) to feather pillows and even a ""white noise"" devise for sleeping. The garden area, too, is lovely. The host also let us park our car in their driveway saving us from street parking. Thank you! We will be back.",Oakland,0
"East Bay Studio Oasis - Rest, Relax, Or See It All","David & Camille’s place was warm and cozy. It had everything we needed and more. First off, the bed comforter and pillows were amazing! We slept like babies. Their home is super clean and although it looks small it’s spacious and has a great restroom with a great shower!    I loved everything about my stay. David responds fast, the bart is close by, there are great restaurants and brunch spots near by that I will miss dearly and they provide everything you might think of that makes for a great/easy stay. Felt like home during Christmas Eve and I’m so glad I booked my stay here for that weekend. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it and felt welcomed. They have amazing touches that really make you feel at home. Thanks guys!!",Oakland,0
Elmwood cottage,"This was our second stay at Susan’s place. This apartment is the cleanest, most quiet place that we have rented. Susan is a helpful and responsive host. 

We love the radiant heat floors and the spacious shower in the bathroom. We usually just have breakfast  in the apartment, but there are full-size, top-end appliances if one wished to cook. We make use of the wonderful washer and dryer that are available so that we can pack light.

We hope to be able to return to this rental on a future visit.

En Suite.  Full Privacy.  Breakfast.  Value.,"This was a great experience for my daughter and I! We were unfortunate in that we couldn't meet our hosts as they were away, but also very fortunate in that we had the whole lovely house to ourselves, for the price of a shared accommodation.  It was very well located, near many restaurants with diverse cuisine, as well as very close to the lovely Lake Merritt, Children's Fairyland, and not too far a walk to the BART and downtown Oakland. We felt safe in the neighbourhood at all times, and slept very comfortably in our room. 
We mainly used the house as a base to explore San Francisco, travelling mainly by shared Lyft rides ( a nice way to meet the friendly people of the Bay Area!) as well as by BART. We did have a full Oakland day as well, both in the immediate neighbourhood of the house as well as surrounding neighbourhoods, and another morning where we went to the awesome Grand Lake Farmer's Market, a short walk from the house. Had I had more time, I would spend more time exploring Oakland, where there is lots to do, and nicer weather than SF!
I hope to return again one day, big thank you to our hosts!!",Oakland,0
En Suite.  Full Privacy.  Breakfast.  Value.,"This is THE place to go when visiting Bay Area / San Fransisco / Oakland!

Pat and Lynn are really lovely people, they do everything to make you feel at home and enjoy your stay.

On our first morning we did not have any dollars yet, so they lent us some money to get on a bus to the city. 

They are both in for some good conversations when you like to, but they completely give you your privacy when you want it.

The room is perfect, really private with a great bathroom  completely for you. It’s clean and the bed is really good.

Now go make that reservation!!",Oakland,0
Garden cottage in convenient Oakland location.,"Deanna's place is really special. We had 2 lovely days and nights here and enjoyed every moment. The cottage is just lovely, the kind of place you want to wrap up at the end of the holiday and take back home with you!  Deanna and David were friendly, approachable and the perfect hosts. The residential area is also very pleasant. We were there during the Oakland marathon so the place was busy and buzzing, which only added to the atmosphere. The cottage is stocked with just about everything you could possibly want for your stay with plenty of thoughtful touches (edible and otherwise). Would love to come and stay here again in the future. Thankyou!",Oakland,0
"Grand Lake, Oakland, 1 BR garden apt -newly built!","Brian and Sarah’s place is exactly how it looks in the pictures! It was bright, clean, and beautiful. The space is perfect for 3-4 people. We had stayed in this general vicinity before so we knew it was close to everywhere we wanted to go. There are cute coffee shops and bars/restaurants in walking distance. There are other places you can get to in an Uber or Lyft for under $10 which is awesome. We loved that they had breakfast items in the fridge for us - so sweet! You can definitely hear the kids running around upstairs, but that didn’t really bother us because they mentioned that they had kids and pets in the original post so we knew what we were getting ourselves into. We were early risers anyway. They were super quiet at night, too. Overall, a beautiful home for a very reasonable price. I would absolutely suggest this place to others! We will definitely stay here again.",Oakland,0
"Grand Lake, Oakland, 1 BR garden apt -newly built!","We travel a great deal and have stayed at many nice airbnb homes. Brian and Sarah's place was one of the nicest so far. The place was setup beautifully to accommodate my husband, myself and our grown son for a few days. We enjoyed wine on the patio in the late afternoons and cooked breakfast in the morning. They even stocked breakfast staples (Including Coffee) so we did not have to drive or walk anywhere until we were ready. Their place was spotless and so very comfortable. My husband wants me to ask them the brand of comforter on the bed, he loved it very much.",Oakland,0
"Island Living! Private entry,separate and secure.","Melissa’s place was an amazing surprise! My boyfriend and I were there for 7 days and it went by so fast. I swear we didn’t want to leave. 

When we first got there, we found post-it notes all around the place with instructions that made it easy to settle in. We met up with Melissa for a bit who welcomed us and made us feel at home. She provided us with breakfast (yogurt and granola), tea, coffee and fruits! A really nice touch. 

Throughout our stay, she was always there to respond to any questions or concerns we had. She was always very sweet and kind to us. 

We would definitely stay here again! The room was beautiful and worth every penny! P.S. tune in to Jazz 91 on her cute little radio. She had it preset when we got there and we fell in love with the station.",Oakland,0
Little house in a Berkeley garden,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Little House for 2 nights, on President's Day weekend (also my birthday!). The house was ADORABLE and so so comfortable.  We didn't get to visit with Erica much,  but she was so sweet and hospitable, even from the sidelines. All of the little details were so well thought out, from the robes and teas to the guidebook and coffee.  We loved every minute of our trip! We'll definitely try to book the Little House again next time we're going up to the Bay Area. Thanks,  Erica!",Oakland,0
Little house in a Berkeley garden,"Would definitely recommend this garden cottage! Great for 1-2 people, the space is private, intimate, and relaxing. The location is perfect—close enough to San Francisco and surrounding cities but away from the chaos of the city. The location was our main hub as we traveled throughout CA during the week. The little house was very clean and well kept. The outdoor shower was a great extra feature— we were a little doubtful about showering in the chilly evenings, but the hot shower with surrounding fairy lights was HEAVENLY. Erica was an amazing host and checked in with us during our stay. She was thoughtful and made sure every detail was perfect— leaving coffee beans and grinder for us, asking beforehand what kind of milk we use, leaving fresh robes for us to use for the outdoor shower. Also, the process of checking in and out was super easy and fast. We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental.",Oakland,0
Little house in a Berkeley garden,"A gem of a place in an enchanted garden. It’s small but tasteful, confortable and inspiring. There is everything you need from delicious coffee, the best tea selection, confortable mattress and a poetic je ne sais quoi to the whole experience. Once we got to know the area, we loved grocery shopping at the Berkeley Bowl market and getting our breakfast there in the morning. We felt like locals and loved it! Erica is a delightful hostess, helpful and thoughtful.Thank you Erica for this wonderful experience.",Oakland,0
Lovely garden entry studio near shops and transit,"Marty & David are great host. What we love about Marty’s place is, you have your own privacy & they also respect your privacy. Her place was so clean & immaculate. We also have our own parking place on their drive way which is so convenient for us. It’s hard to park in Alameda & one thing that worried us at night, we might not get a parking space on the street. At least with Marty’s place we have our own parking space even if we return to the studio late night.. no worries  & no stress . We will book again with Marty’s place when we return to the Bay Area for a long weekend getaway in the future. Thankful that we had a wonderful & pleasant stay at Marty’s place.",Oakland,0
Lovely garden entry studio near shops and transit,"Marty’s place was the best place we could imagine staying during our vacation to San Francisco!  Her place was immaculately clean and the bed was super comfortable.  She has done a fantastic job making sure no detail is forgotten.  Marty took the time to print maps and schedules to help us figure out how to take a quick (cheap) ferry ride over into San Francisco.  This saved us quite a bit of money and time for parking and driving in the crazy traffic.  The neighborhood and Alameda area were extremely safe and clean.  We ate in several nice restaurants close to the house and even caught a movie in the lovely nostalgic Alameda Theatre.  Beautiful home, beautiful area.",Oakland,0
Lovely garden entry studio near shops and transit,"This cozy, colorful, clean room is just the place in which to relax. Every amenity has been thought of including extra pillows, TV, reading lamps for everyone, tissues for all, hair dryer, even things like toothbrushes and makeup remover!  The garden is lovely, delightful restaurants and cafes are within walking distance, the beds are comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed our all too brief stay here. Marty herself is warm and welcoming but gives one privacy, a perfect combination. If you use the Oakland airport it is only minutes away. We highly recommend her place.",Oakland,0
Luxury Casita in Rockridge Garden,"Diana's casita is absolutely beautiful! The space was clean and bright due to the natural light that comes through the windows. With luxurious touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plants, I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. We visited many of the places suggested on the card left for us in the room -- and loved them all! The space is centrally located, a close distance to great attractions in Oakland and in Berkeley. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our week in Oakland, CA!",Oakland,0
Luxury Casita in Rockridge Garden,"This place is awesome! Great location, beautiful walk to the BART, and walking distance to a number of amazing local mainstays and businesses in a hip part of town. The place is super easy to get in an out of without feeling obtrusive and us super comfortable with lots of great design and style. The fridge was stocked with awesome beer, the bed was incredibly comfy, and the bathroom has a heated floor...what the heck else do you need? Also, loved that there wasn’t a TV. Go sit outside on the awesome patio and talk about how lame its going to be when you have to leave this place.",Oakland,0
Luxury Casita in Rockridge Garden,"The space is exactly as represented in the photos and description:   this is a very sleek, stylish, clean,  and  modern casita, with a great bed, bath,  and amenities.  Particularly loved the wonderful light, windows and  design elements of the ceiling and interior.  Diane was prompt and clear in all communications, and very warm and helpful at check-in and check-out, and in sharing some excellent tips for restaurants, coffee shops and neighborhood activities.  We enjoyed every element of our stay at Diane's place and hope to be back again soon!",Oakland,0
Luxury Casita in Rockridge Garden,"The house is spotless! It looks way better than the photos. It’s a beautiful modern tastefully decorated clean guesthouse. Shower was very warm, water pressure was perfect, they have everything you need for your stay—hair drier, iron board, heater, ref-ridge. I just felt very comfortable staying with my 1-year old baby. Diana kindly let us use her backyard to decorate for baby’s birthday table, and we got a beautiful photo and unforgettable memories. The patio garden is very pretty and Mia was so adorable and calm. My daughter loved her, too! She also gave us a crib for my baby. As a former resident from the east bay, the location is just perfect—lots of shops and restaurants on the main street, nice and safe neighborhood,  close to SF, near berkeley,  also close to korean restaurants. 
Diana is very responsive, and she was even away when we stayed, but responded to all requests right away.  We’ll stay here again when we visit SF!",Oakland,0
Magical Modern Cottage,"We were greeted by Colin right after we parked. The street is lovely and quiet, it feels like a safe neighborhood with a lot of people who have probably lived in their homes a while. The house we stayed in is a back house with gorgeous landscaping and a beautiful bedroom; there is a cool skylight and we could see the moon at night. I loved staying in Oakland and it really felt like we were removed from the city, when we’d go back to retreat during the day/evening. There was a list of tips provided for us to go to eat, get coffee/drinks, etc. I wish we could’ve stayed longer to try out their other recommendations, hopefully we can go back to stay with them soon! ",Oakland,0
Magical Modern Cottage,"Fans of modern architecture will love what has been done in such a tiny cottage. Clean, cozy, comfortable (if you are willing to navigate a tight staircase a few times each day).  Great mattress on the bed. Nice shared back yard with main dwelling - we sat with a glass of wine awaiting the rain and watching the birds.  No microwave, but there is a fridge, very small (6” wide) sink & two burners for a basic meal. Better choice is to explore Rockridge/Temescal area eateries, many within 1/2 to a mile walk.  Relatively quiet area given proximity to major Oakland-Berkeley streets and Rockridge BART station. 
Colin greeted us upon arrival and told us all we needed to know about the place and area.  Lovely going to sleep upstairs with the rain falling. We had a nice time with a day for exploring & a day mostly on site. Not recommended for those with mobility issues or people really craving  their “elbow room.”",Oakland,0
Modern + Private Guest Suite! 12 mins to SF!!,"Leo’s apartment is a beautiful find in San Francisco with a really wonderful host! Leo was highly responsive, very easy to interact with and left us all the information we needed in advance so we didn’t have to worry or pester about anything. The apartment itself is clean, well furnished (loved having a hair dryer and iron readily available!) with plenty of space. We picked the apartment hoping to find a pleasant space still close to the city for cheaper than in the CBD and that was certainly what we found!",Oakland,0
Modern Retro Private Studio,"First of all, as a host, Justin couldn't be kinder or more helpful with suggestions and answers to any and all questions.  The private room is absolutely lovely.  Contemporary, clean with a light bright feel. It's located on a beautiful street within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and coffee.  I had an absolutely perfect stay and walked everywhere.  Spring has already come to Berkeley with multiple trees and flowers blooming and the scent in the air is pure poetry.  I highly recommend Justin's place and will most definitely be back the the next time I'm in Berkeley",Oakland,0
Modern Retro Private Studio,"Berkeley is such a cool pocket of NorCal, this place is PERFECT for exploring and enjoying all the city has to offer. This place is so cozy comfy, equipped with all the essentials that make it feel like a home, and hosted by the loveliest folks. Justin was so easy to communicate with — he eased all our concerns and ensured our stay was enjoyable. Seriously couldn’t have asked for a better experience! So highly recommended!

(*The bed is ridiculously comfortable!)
(** The location really isn’t all that hilly — especially when taking into account how hilly the Bay Area is in general. Don’t let it deter you!)",Oakland,0
Modern Retro Private Studio,"This is a lovely, tranquil, very clean room in a quiet neighborhood of Berkeley. For me, it was within walking distance of the Downtown Berkeley BART and the north side of the UC Berkeley campus. You do have to walk uphill a bit to get to the place, so keep that in mind if you have luggage other than a backpack. Grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are also within walking distance. I had to make a short job-related trip to UC Berkeley and this place was perfect for getting some work done in the evening. I did not use the microwave or mini-fridge, but the fridge is sizable for being mini! Photos and description are accurate. Justin is exceptionally responsive and promptly replied to my request and questions. Check-in and check-out were super easy. I highly recommend Justin's place if you need a nice, clean place to stay in the East Bay Area and do not require a kitchen!",Oakland,0
Modern Retro Private Studio,"Justin's studio is a nicely decorated first-floor room next to his garage. It is painted a charming shade of blue,  has a lovely wood floor and is accentuated with white trim and window shades.  It has everything we needed for our two-day stay and is located conveniently near Berkeley's Gourmet Ghetto.  My husband and I enjoy walking and looking at the local architecture, and the streets abutting the studio provided abundant opportunities for exploring the different building styles. Justin, himself, was very accommodating.  He was quick to respond to any of our requests and gave good advice about visiting some of the sights nearby.  On our last morning there, we had delicious croissants and lattes at Masse's, a little slice of Paris on Shattuck.",Oakland,0
Modern Zen Studio Cottage in Temescal,"We absolutely loved this little space that actually felt incredibly spacious considering. The aesthetic was on point, it was clean, it was comfortable and it was in the perfect location. Walking distance from everything you needed and a short Lyft ride to the Fox Theater. Parking was no issue. Kim & Taj were quick in responding when I booked this space months prior and very thorough in check in/out instructions several days before arriving. Would stay here again in a heartbeat and wish I could call that little space home! Thanks so much for having us.",Oakland,0
Modern Zen Studio Cottage in Temescal,"Kim and Taj's cottage was the perfect place to stay when we were in Oakland for a wedding. The Temescal and Rockridge areas were really fun to explore, and there were great restaurants right around the corner from their house. Street parking was easy over the weekend and it's only a 5 minute walk from the BART. The cottage itself was clean, light (with tons of windows) and a lovely design. We felt like we had our own tiny house for the weekend! My husband and I would both definitely stay here again.",Oakland,0
Modern Zen Studio Cottage in Temescal,"We loved our stay at this cute and stylish studio. I loved the colors, the decoration, and the natural light in the morning. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the neighborhood was quiet. Loved the size of the bathroom and shower. The studio was clean and had many great amenities like a heater, fan, and humidifier. The location is ideal. Street parking was easy to find. The studio is close to a brewery and to some of my favorites places to eat in the Bay:  Bake-sale Betty's and Burma Superstar.  I would definitely stay here again and cannot recommend this place enough.",Oakland,0
Need an awesome space to crash?,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely time staying at Christian's! Christian was such a welcoming host who always made sure that we were having a good time and gave us loads of insider tips to better explore the city. Leading up to the trip, he was very communicative, too, answering questions within minutes of us asking them.

The house is located in Oakland near a train station that takes you to the heart of San Francisco within 10  or 15 minutes. The room itself was very cozy, perfectly blending in to the rest of the house, which was very stylishly decorated - from kitchen to bathroom - the whole place felt warm and welcoming.

There's really nothing to criticise - we'd definitely come again!",Oakland,0
Need an awesome space to crash?,"This is the perfect place to stay when in the Bay Area! Christian and Jackie are wonderful, and we were the beneficiaries of the heavenly aroma of baking bread and the delicious results for the rest of our stay! They were very helpful with advice on transportation and food, and great for a general chat as well. The house and room are very clean and bigger than expected, and I love the decor (dinosaurs everywhere!). It's an easy walk to the West Oakland BART station and the very next stop is in San Francisco. Great value, great location, great hosts, I highly recommend them!",Oakland,0
Need an awesome space to crash?,"Staying with Jackie and Christian was more fun and comfortable than I expected! They shared their local knowledge, homemade bread, common space, and activity recommendations. They were available to chat and debrief after a full day's activities, but not overbearing at all! I would love to come again if I'm back in the SF/Oakland area.

Their street is very comfortable/safe, but a few streets from the BART West Oakland to their home may seem unsafe or less well kept. If you're uncomfortable, getting an Uber/Lyft is quick and convenient, as well as contacting Christian and Jackie for the best walking route. When my friend and I stayed (two women, recent college grads) we had no issues... Just something to keep in mind (just like traveling to any unfamiliar neighborhood). ",Oakland,0
Need an awesome space to crash?,"I had a very comfortable stay at Christian's place, the space was great and very clean. I arrived very early to drop off my bag, and they welcomed me right in, allowed me to leave my bag while they finished cleaning, and went ahead and gave me a key and showed me to ropes before I headed out to explore for the day. When I returned everything was clean and lovely, and I enjoyed sharing the common space with fellow airbnb'ers in the morning, chatting over coffee. Loved sitting outside in the garden/patio area as well! About a 15 minute walk to town, very doable, and also very accessible with buses and the BART station. Thank you, I would stay again!",Oakland,0
Need an awesome space to crash?,"Staying at Christian and Jackie's was absolute perfect. The house is lovely, clean and spacious and there is even a back yard where you can sit and have a nice breakfast in the morning. The hosts are friendly and helpful. Christian gave us brochures and tips on what to do as soon as we got there. Jackie baked some bread and it was delicious. The house is very close to West Oakland BART station and it's a perfect location to visiting both Oakland and San Francisco. I definitely recommend to stay at their place",Oakland,0
New modern Euro-style studio in Elegant Victorian,"Cara’s Airbnb is one of the best we’ve stayed in. For a studio the place is organized very well that it still felt spacious. The decor is modern, the place is very clean, and as a host she communicates very well. We didn’t have time to go grocery shopping and we were delighted there was water and food items available to us in the fridge if we wanted them. There is a train track nearby and once in a while you can hear the train going by, but the noise didn’t bother us. Thank you again for everything and I would love to come stay here again the next time we visit Berkeley!",Oakland,0
Private Cabin by Lake Merritt,"This is our second stay at the cabin with gracious hosts Dennis and Amy.  We chose it for the proximity to our daughter and son-in-law, but we would choose it even if we did not have family in the neighborhood.  The outdoor shower is amazing, and I love the there is no TV there: it's a nice respite.  There is wifi if needed, but honestly, we just enjoyed our morning coffee and heading out into the city. The location is perfect for enjoying many of Oakland's prime areas.  Do not hesitate to book this place for it's location, restful sleep, fantastic shower, and getting to know Dennis and Amy!",Oakland,0
Private Cabin by Lake Merritt,"We had a wonderful stay. The only couple of items I would mention that could be improved are we had difficulty working the shades on the windows, and the hot water in the shower seemed to run out a bit too quickly. The outdoor shower though was great, and refreshing, and a very unique enjoyable experience. Overall it is such a great space, location, amenities as advertised, and Amy and Dennis were so responsive, welcoming, and we loved meeting their dog too! We felt safe, and it was nice and quite and peaceful. My husband also fell in love with the coffee :) . Thank-you for everything Amy & Dennis! We hope to be back again.",Oakland,0
Private Cabin by Lake Merritt,"Had a lovely two night stay.  Dennis greeted us and showed us around and was very welcoming and funny.  We loved all the little touches of the cabin - comfortable bed, extra towels, soap and shampoo, sparkling water, privacy.   It has a classic antique sort of feeling and everything is so well maintained you could feel that this little space has been well cared for. We especially liked tuning into the jazz station from the analog radio. On a quiet street just a couple blocks from shops/restaurants and about a 30 minute stroll along the lake to BART.",Oakland,0
Private Cabin by Lake Merritt,"This place is a gem. A cozy, über homey private spot w a great location. When I first got there, Dennis greeted and acquainted me with the place. I've never been in a tiny home but my guess is this is what it would be like. My favorite parts are the loft bed (heads up you do need to climb a ladder) & outdoor shower. There's clean towels, a kitchenette (no stove), tea, coffee and even extra toiletries to use if you need. I loved the sparkling water in the fridge as well as the robe and slippers to use for the bath. Waking up in the morning or ending my day with a run/walk around the lake (just steps away) was the best. Central location makes anything you need an Uber ride/Bart/walk away. Mahalo Amy & Dennis for the beautiful stay. I got to fall in love w Oakland. Will definitely be back!",Oakland,0
Private Cabin by Lake Merritt,"Amy & Dennis’s cabin exceeded my expectations. Communication was timely and thoughtful, and it was very easy to check in and check out. They were very accommodating about checking us in when we arrived a little earlier than expected. I was at first nervous about the outdoor shower situation but it is incredibly private and the area is kept very clean. The bathrobes and slippers they provide are also a nice touch! The cabin is very homey, and the coffee, tea, water, sugar, and cream provided were all very much appreciated. The speaker system is GREAT, and overall you can just tell that they love their home and want other guests to feel that way as well. Plus, there’s just something very charming and nostalgic about sleeping in a loft that I love. I would definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in town!",Oakland,0
Private Cabin by Lake Merritt,"Wonderful hosts, awesome location! Amy and Dennis were lovely hosts, and their cabin location is nothing short of amazing. We felt like we were in a cabin oasis, with the city laid out just beyond the gate. A truly unique space, rustic yet urbane, with every detail you could think of - even the outdoor shower was quaint and cosy. Our hosts were available and responsive, and their local tips were on the nose. Listening to live jam sessions was an added bonus! We felt right at home, and we were glad to have taken a friend’s recommendation to book this location. Thanks, Amy and Dennis!",Oakland,0
Private Casita with Stunning View,"Melia's casita is a wonderful place to stay when in the Bay Area!  I have stayed at many homes when visiting family in the Bay Area, and this one was the most well-appointed, with thoughtful touches for decorating and amenities for breakfast, among other highlights.  The view from the private deck is very lovely, and we had fun eating breakfast in the morning and watching planes taking off and landing at Oakland Airport.  I would highly recommend this great place for any visitors, and I hope to be able to stay there again in the near future!",Oakland,0
Private Casita with Stunning View,"Melia's place was outstanding! It is in a great location, quiet neighborhood and easy to find and navigate. We did a lot in and around the city, about an hour drive anytime we went into San Francisco but that's because of bridge traffic.  Stunning views right from the porch! Her place was sparkling clean with a ton of thoughtful touches and amenities. Such as breakfast options, cooking supplies, and a french press for coffee lovers!  The bed was comfortable with lots of pillows and extra blankets! After long days out in the city we enjoyed being able to cuddle up on the couch and stream some movies. We  really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it for anyone looking to explore the beauty in and around San Francisco! Thank you!",Oakland,0
Private Casita with Stunning View,"This was my first time using Airbnb and Melia certainly made it a pleasant experience! She is the type of host who truly cares about the comfort and satisfaction of her guests. She provides everything you need, and then some. Not to mention her home has an amazing view! I highly recommend staying here for a trip to California. It was not far at all from San Francisco and you could easily get to the major highway. Melia was super friendly and accommodating. We would love to stay here again for our next trip to California!",Oakland,0
Private Casita with Stunning View,"Me and my husband stayed in Melia’s Casita for a weekend for our anniversary and I must stay, it more than exceeded our expectations! Melia was an amazing host, she put fresh fruit for us, coffee, milk, snacks, and more. She was also very responsive and we had a lovely time chatting with her. As for the Casita it was absolutely beautiful! The touches makes it super unique and quaint, it was extremely clean, and the view was amazing. I must say we really enjoyed our time and will def be back if we come to the Bay Area :)",Oakland,0
Private cottage in enclosed gardens,"We absolutely loved this private cottage right by the Laurel District! It is just a short walk to some neighborhood restaurants and coffee shops, and only a 10 minute drive to Lake Merritt or downtown Oakland. BART is also only 10 minutes away , so you can't beat this place if you want to be secluded, but be close to everything as well! 

The cottage itself has everything you need, and was very clean and cozy. The beautiful gardens and hot tub were an added bonus! We would definitely book again :)",Oakland,0
Private cottage in enclosed gardens,"I don’t want to write a review because I don’t want to share this place with everyone, it’s an amazing spot. Their home is a beautiful spot, clean, quiet, easy parking, easy access to freeway, guides and recommendations for dining and activities in the area, and a patio that we loved! sitting on and drinking our coffees at the end of our day. 
Ben and Jacqueline are amazing hosts, giving us tips on the area and San Fran, warned us about tolls, reservations needed for certain spots, and where the best people watching would be. 
I’d highly recommend seeing if they have an opening for you. ",Oakland,0
Private Room in Idyllic Craftsman,"Christina is a very gracious and thoughtful host.  She was pretty responsive in her timing while we were messaging each other to figure out check-in logistics.  Once in, the house was at a nice temperature and the room was very clean. She had fresh filtered water and a station with coffee and tea in the room. I got to meet her the next day and she is just a lovely and kind person!  (Her dog is full of love as well!)  She made sure that all was okay during my stay.  I highly recommend staying at her place if you ever need to be in Bay/Oakland area.",Oakland,0
Private Room in Idyllic Craftsman,"Christina is the most lovely person. She really looked after me, at a time when I really needed it. I was made to feel completely at home, being offered a bath with some yummy bath salts, and full access to her gorgeous kitchen and everything it had to offer. The room even had a little 'hot shot' machine, that heats up a mug of water for an instant tea! I had never seen that before, but it was the best thing for a cozy stay. Thank you, Christina, for the heart and soul you brought to the AirBnB!",Oakland,0
Private Room in Idyllic Craftsman,"I really enjoyed my stay at Christina’s place. She made it felt just like home. The house has a lot of personality and art, and her dog (Ida) was such a sweetheart! I love that I was welcomed to utilize the living room, kitchen, and patio area. Everything was well equipped. The room itself is nice and clean, and the pillow was comfy. 

Christina was a great host and made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable. She recommended some great places to check out in Oakland during my visit. The location of the house was fantastic - it was 15 minutes or less from grocery stores, 24 hour fitness, parks, hiking trails, movie theaters, restaurants, etc. Parking in the neighborhood was no issue at all. If I come back to Oakland by myself, I’d definitely stay here again. 

",Oakland,0
Private Room in Idyllic Craftsman,"Christina’s place is a magical haven in the city. The room itself is so spacious and the bed had me sleeping so deeply I forgot where I was when I woke up. It’s supremely quiet there.

One of the most surprising and delightful things about her place is that nothing in the kitchen is off-limits. It’s truly like you’re staying at a friend’s house. I loved her home and yard with ducks! Quack quack 

The neighborhood is pleasant for walking around if you stick to the high streets. I like to walk to cafes and shops, but this location isn’t for doing that. There is plenty within a short drive though. The views walking around the neighborhood were nice ",Oakland,0
Private Stand-Alone Garden Room!,"Louise was such a wonderful host - even though we only crossed paths in person once, her warmth showed through all of her communications with me. This was a lovely, relaxing place to spend a few nights. The outdoor shower was fantastic - I now think all showers should include blue sky, birds chirping, and live plants! Super cozy and comfortable bed, the space heater quickly took care of the chilly nights, lots of little touches like tea and snacks. I would absolutely stay here again if I find myself back in the area!",Oakland,0
Private Stand-Alone Garden Room!,"Louise’s place is a private a room (separate from the main house) with a bed, desk, some chairs and some mirrors. As described, there is no bathroom inside the room. The bathroom and toilet are outside and you have to walk a short path (through a lovely garden) to get there. All linens, towels and toiletries are provided. Louise is also very accommodating. I needed a iron and hair dryer and they were provided for me. Also provided is a space heater, which works well, an  umbrella and a flashlight. Louise is an excellent communicator and host; though we did not get to meet in person, I got a good vibe. I highly recommend staying here!",Oakland,0
Private Stand-Alone Garden Room!,"The best part about staying here is difficult to choose. Louise was great--she was very responsive and respectfully available if you need anything. She also went above and beyond to provide local tips--her guidebook was amazing. The cottage itself was charming and clean as well as outfitted with everything you might need. The bed was comfortable and easy to nest in the fluffy pillows and duvets. The setting was lovely in her amazing garden which you are able to enjoy even if only on your way to and from the outdoor bathroom--which may have been my favorite part! There's something so satisfying about simply existing and appreciating what you have that added the magic ingredient to this stay. This is my 5th Airbnb in the area, and I'd book this one first if it is available!",Oakland,0
"PRIVT Studio In-Law 5Min to Bart&Oracle, 25Min S.F","Julia and Adriana are amazing hosts! If you are visiting Oakland/SF and want to be close to OAK, Oracle Arena/Coliseum--this is where you want to be! I came to Oakland to attend a concert and was blown away by the studio. It is a quick drive from the airport and even shorter drive to Oracle! 

You can tell that a lot of time, effort and care was put into the studio. It was clean, cozy, and offered everything you might need! No detail, no matter how small, was overlooked!

The bathroom featured a great shower with all the amenities (body wash, shampoo, conditioner) and good water pressure--because yes, we all know that matters! :) A double sink with counter space came in super handy as I was staying with a friend. It is well-decorated, well-lit and felt like home. Everything was brand new!

Some of the best details are not currently featured in the photos, so I'd like to call them out: next to the fridge was a cute baker's rack with everything you could possibly need--mugs, cups, wine glasses, plates, bowls, silverware--you name it. They also offered a variety of tea and starbucks ground coffee--as well as sugar, creamer etc. A coffee maker and electric kettle rounded the entire thing out! In the fridge, a filtered water pitcher waits for you, already filled.

A table large enough for four now sits in front of the window where the desk used to be (see pictures for reference). The desk has been moved closer to the door, which makes it a convenient spot to place your keys or bags. 

The bed was big and soft and we honestly fell in love with the comforter. 

Parking is available on and off the street, and the property is gated! 

Communication with Julia and Adriana was great--they were quick to respond and you could tell they were really invested in your comfort--so much hospitality!

Overall, an AMAZING experience. I'm looking forward to coming back--now that I've found this gem, I can't wait for the next concert at Oracle!",Oakland,0
"PRIVT Studio In-Law 5Min to Bart&Oracle, 25Min S.F","This is a beautiful spot. Sparkling clean, cute, and memorable. The decor brings an incredible atmosphere. There’s a plant with a vine along an upper wood beam that just creates a beautiful environment. Our stay was very comfortable, and relaxing. Loved the location in Oakland as well. Very easy to get to downtown Oakland or San Francisco. Check-in was incredibly smooth as well as check out. Everything is just very smooth and laid out for the guest. If you have any questions or concerns the response is very quick. Highly recommend, and planning on coming back. We loved it.",Oakland,0
Quiet and Comfortable 1 bedroom apt,"I suddenly needed a quiet spot to work remotely from and this place was perfect. It was great to wake up, open the window or French doors and get to hear all the birds chirping and see the sun filtering in through the trees. Joelle and Greg are excellent hosts with a top-notch location. Joelle was always fast to reply to messages and was very nice to interact with in person. The unit was super clean, decor was lovely, and had everything I needed. If I ever need another secluded work spot in the future - I sure hope this location will be available. :)",Oakland,0
Quiet and Comfortable 1 bedroom apt,"Joelle is an AMAZING host. Honestly, she went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was as best as it could have been. If we ever come back to Oakland we're definitely going to stay with her again. Read on for more details! Location: Located in Oakland, it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to get to other places in Oakland/San Francisco/the Bay area. Very easy transportation for Lyft/Uber, which is what we used exclusively while we were there. Never had to wait more than 20 minutes for pick-up. Outside of surge pricing, average cost of Uber trips was around $15 (for somewhere in Oakland/the Bay) up to around $20 (if you wanted to make the trek over the bridge to someplace in San Francisco). Sometimes on the way back to the Airbnb the Uber drivers will get confused (Oakland is huge lol), but if you tell them that you're going to the ""Oakland hills"" that'll help them out a bit. The home: SO clean. Comes with an Alexa set up, which was great because we played music in the mornings and to check that day's weather before we went out. Also has a great security system that Joelle will make sure you know how to use if safety is a concern. In that same vein, the neighborhood the home is located in is very quiet and lovely, so we truly never worried about our safety once we arrived. The washer/dryer hook up is handy for cleaning your clothes. It's a little small to save space, but you could still fit about a week's worth of laundry in there if you want to clean your clothes during your stay or before you leave. And Joelle makes sure that she keeps everything stocked that you might need: blankets (even an extra one), sheets, toilet paper, soap, other toiletries, eating/cooking utensils, etc. It looks exactly as it does in the pictures too, so no need to worry about overly flattering Photoshop enhancements. Joelle herself: Like I mentioned above, Joelle is outstanding. We arrived in Oakland about 2 hours earlier than planned & she was so flexible as she wanted to greet us when we arrived. Once we arrived she personally gave us a tour/rundown of the Airbnb & made sure that we knew how to use the security system. We also needed a ride to the grocery store that next morning (around 9 am). Instead of having us take an Uber, Joelle even drove us to the store herself & waited for us to finish shopping to take us home. She also responds very quickly to any texts/messages, so getting in contact with her was never a problem. And she makes sure to let you know that if you ever need her, for anything, to just let her know. Lastly, she even has a folder for getting to know Oakland/San Fran/the Bay for residents. It's full of places to eat (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), and things (in Oakland...",Oakland,0
Quiet and Comfortable 1 bedroom apt,"Joelle's space is beautiful and amazing! Our favorite space was actually the patio. Me and my bf had work to get done during the trip, and it was amazing sitting out in the sunshine with a glass of wine and our laptops. Downtown SF is an east 20-30 min drive. The neighborhood is lovely. Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill). Highly recommend this place! Also, I just noticed Joelle offers a larger space, which is just as beautiful. I hope to be back soon! Thank you for welcoming us, Joelle!",Oakland,0
Secluded backyard cottage,"Laurel and Sky's place was lovely. They had everything we needed for our 2 day stay. It's on a nice hill in a nice neighborhood.  Uber can get expensive, but there is express uber that can get you to the across the bridge for $10<, you just may have to ride with other passengers! 

The cottage is very efficient, and we were coming from a hot place (vegas) so we were able to leave the sliding windows open the best breeze ever! They have all the amenities you'd need on a vacation. Definitely would stay again",Oakland,0
Secluded backyard cottage,"My boyfriend and I loved the backyard cottage! Smaller space, but we still loved that it was very cozy and private for two people, especially just relaxing watching tv. It had everything we needed, and I really appreciated the space heater! We were even able to make use of the mini fridge and toaster oven as well. Sitting on the patio and enjoying the view made for a lovely last few minutes of our stay this morning! 

Communicating with Laurel and Sky was easy, as they replied back to our comments promptly! It was fairly easy to find parking near their premises, and the pathway to the cottage is mostly well lit at night. It is close to BART, safely tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. I would definitely recommend people to stay here!",Oakland,0
Secluded backyard cottage,"We had a wonderful stay in Laurel and Sky’s lovely cottage. The cottage is in a quiet neighborhood and the many windows make it light, sunny and welcoming with a view onto the surrounding hills and the secluded back yard. Even though we arrived very late, Laurel and Skye made our check-in easy and had left some lights on to show us the way. They kindly checked in with us the next day to see if we needed anything. The cottage is very well appointed and  we found everything neat, tidy and very clean. 
We would definitely recommend this rental to other visitors to Oakland. Thank you Laurel and Skye and hope to stay with you again.",Oakland,0
Secluded backyard cottage,"We stayed here for just under two weeks and loved it! With the spring rain we were surrounded by lush green, had a mountain view, a outdoor deck, well renovated and kept studio apartment to be cozy in, and with a car it was easy to get to amenities and ‘the city’. We cooked mostly in the toaster oven and it worked great with some creative meal planning. While we were just behind the main house there was never any noise or disturbance and we had tons of privacy. We only met one of the hosts in person briefly, but all the communication through messages was friendly, prompt, and informative. A really lovey place!",Oakland,0
Spacious Private Garden Studio,"We loved our stay at this stylish studio. The neighborhood was beautiful and we spent a lot of time just walking around and admiring the homes. The place itself was quiet and spacious, with a private entrance and great natural lighting. The shower was hot and we appreciated the tea and coffee in the morning. Check-in was easy using a keypad; however I did have to reach out first on the day of arrival to get the check in information. We also had to park on the street and move the car in the morning - which is standard for the area! Overall we really enjoyed the studio and would definitely return. ",Oakland,0
Spacious Private Garden Studio,"Justin's spot was just as expected since they provide a lot of details, which is always nice with Airbnb. Communication was incredibly fast since I had a few questions in advance. I parked a car and it was very easy to find parking. I left before the street parking time limit kicked in so this wasn't an issue for me. I appreciate that this area feels safe and it's easy and pleasant for walking. 

I loved the photos to describe how to find the entrance to the unit. I wish every host did this...I arrived during the day but still found it super helpful. Thanks!",Oakland,0
Sunny Rm Near Temescal and Piedmont,"Pam and Richard are wonderful hosts. We arrived a bit earlier than we expected, and they graciously welcomed us and allowed us to settle in. Their beautiful home is filled with sunlight and plants, which contributes to its comfortable and peaceful atmosphere. They also provide breakfast and great conversation in the mornings, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The room is quite cozy and comfortable with lovely windows overlooking their front garden. Their neighborhood is in an ideal location within walking distance of numerous excellent restaurants, as well as BART. I highly recommend Pam and Richard's place!",Oakland,0
Super Spacious Bright Happy Home,"Leslie’s home is SO adorable, cute, happy—everything we hoped for and more. All of my guests couldn’t stop raving about the house. Even hours later after settling in, I found myself looking around the home and smiling at how home-y, clean and stylish everything was.

Before checking in, she was very responsive and wanted to accommodate all our needs. I had the pleasure of meeting Leslie on arrival. She’s so sweet, considerate and thoughtful! She made sure everything was in its place for us—she really wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. 

Leslie had instructions (wifi, thermostat, tv, etc) and rules printed out for us. The kitchen was stocked with all of our cooking needs (pots, pans, utensils) and all the cabinets were labeled so everything was easy to navigate. 

I actually work very close to Leslie’s home so I am familiar with the area. So I can vouch for the restaurants like anchalee, cafe trieste, etc as very cute and yummy places to eat! 

I really wish that I could have stayed here longer, better yet live in a home exactly like hers (that’s how much i love it!!!)

I recommend Leslie’s home and hospitality a million times over! stay here! I would give her more than 5 stars if i could! you won’t regret it!!!! :)",Oakland,0
Super Spacious Bright Happy Home,"We loved staying at Leslie’s adorable house!  It was such a comfort to be able to wake up each morning in such a pleasant space. The morning light is wonderful and I absolutely loved being able to make breakfast in the extremely well appointed real cook’s kitchen. The knives were nice and sharp, there was plenty of olive oil for making eggs, the counters and fridge were sparkling clean and I always appreciate a gas stove!  It felt so homey it was almost like I was staying in my big sister’s house that she had lovingly prepped for me.   Leslie’s thoughtful, speedy  attentiveness made the lodging part of our trip an effortless high point.

Super Spacious Bright Happy Home,"When my gf and I walked through the door we were blown away by how awesome this place is. I wish we could’ve spent more time just chilling at this home lol we were seriously in love! Leslie is an outstanding host and went above and beyond setting up her home for an amazing stay. 

First of all, the open floor plan, warm lighting, and inviting atmosphere was very welcoming & made us feel right at home. 

Second, every detail had been thought out and arranged to make our stay as breezy as possible. We only stayed a couple days, but the house is set up for even a 2 week-long relaxing stay. Plenty of privacy and free street parking as well. 

Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a cozy, clean, and fun hideaway after a long day of exploring SF. I hope we can come back soon!  Literally nothing bad to say. AHHH, WE LOVED IT HERE!!",Oakland,0
Super Spacious Bright Happy Home,"Leslie's place was impeccable on every level. The home was so bright and cheerful, and the kitchen had all the amenities and then some for those that are super inspired to cook for themselves. Quiet neighborhood and within walking distance for basic needs and amenities. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the instructions for the guidelines to honor within her home were very clear and simple.  She has taken great care to offer many special touches to make the experience feel like you have arrived to a well cared for home, to offer all of your basic needs and then some.  The only thing that I would have enjoyed and  made it perfect would have been a bathtub! Although every other aspect of this lovely home made up for it! She was a wonderful host to top it off!",Oakland,0
Super Spacious Bright Happy Home,"Immaculate home with a spacious living room / kitchen area and a nice bedroom tucked in between. The home and garden were beautiful! 

The area was incredibly quiet - but still close to the places I wanted to get to. I loved the morning walk to the BART station. I also walked over to Berkeley Bowl for some groceries and downtown Berkeley for some dinner. 

Leslie was very responsive - and made checkin/checkout a breeze. I would definitely recommend this place if you are wanting to experience all that the Berkeley area has to offer!",Oakland,0
The Cottage at Squirrel End,"The cottage was a great place to stay for a quiet base but within easy reach of San Francisco. We received a friendly welcome from Dan upon arrival and found the cottage spotlessly clean.  The entrance to the cottage felt very private and had a lovely, peaceful woodland feel. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a great shower as well as a big bath and the kitchen offered what we needed for our short stay. It was a pretty short, easy drive into San Francisco and there’s a good bar called Moxy’s just around the corner that was very handy for a quick burger and fries after our evening flight1 Overall, a very nice, conveniently located cottage that we would recommend to others.",Oakland,0
The Cottage at Squirrel End,"Linda and Dan’s place was great! We only stayed one night but we loved it. The location was very convenient and on a nice quiet street. The cottage itself was cute, cozy and comfortable. Check in and check out was very easy. We just so happened to run into Dan and was able to chat with him for a bit. He was a very personable and genuinely nice guy. Communication was very easy and although everything ran smoothly we felt like if anything had arisen Linda and Dan would be very easy to reach and take care of anything within their power. We would love to stay there again the next time we are in town.",Oakland,0
The Garden Hideway,"I had a lovely stay at the Garden Hideaway. Mishaa & Denise are excellent hosts. It's exactly as described - a standalone cottage/room in the garden, separated from the main house. It was cosy and clean. The bed was comfortable; there is a couch, a coffee table, and a small library of books. Mishaa & Denise put fresh coffee, biscuits and water out for when I arrived, which made it feel very homely. The bathroom is a short walk across the pathway, inside the pottery studio. I was the only person using it while I was there. It was spotlessly clean, and there were fresh towels and bathmats placed out. The room is literally a five-minute walk from the Ashby Bart Station - from here I caught the Bart to Downtown Berkeley and San Francisco. There is also a lovely bar on the corner which had live music and poetry reading while I was there. All in all, a wonderful stay - I look forward to staying again the next time I'm in Berkeley.",Oakland,0
The Garden Hideway,"It's an enjoyable experience staying at Mishaa's place. We stayed 8 nights there and were very satisfied with the place. The room is at the back of the house and it stands alone in the garden. It allows large extent of privacy and it's quiet at night that we could have good sleep. Mishaa is so considerate that she arranged a small table with 2 chairs outside the room that we can enjoy the tasty coffee in the morning, surrounded by lovely flowers and plants in the garden. We sometimes met Mishaa in the morning and her warm greetings always made my day! The bathroom is a bit distant but it's clean and well equipped with Mishaa's hand made basin, cups and plate which are beautiful! The location is convenient as it's just 10 minutes walk from BART station.  We are so glad that we chose to stay there.",Oakland,0
The Garden Hideway,We visited San Francisco on our honeymoon and weren't  sure what to expect since neither one of us had ever been to the west coast. We completely fell in love with it! Our host for the week definitely helped us to feel right at home in an unfamiliar place. Mishaa was so kind and hospitable. The cute little hideaway and the sweet little touches added throughout our living area truly made our trip perfect. Mishaa was flexible with our check-in/ check out times when we had a delayed flight in and an early flight out. She gave us some great tips that helped make sure we didn't miss out on anything we wanted to do and also saved us some time and money. We were sad to have not gotten to meet her wife but we're sure she's amazing if she's half as sweet as Mishaa. We were blown away by this great find and hope to be back soon! :),Oakland,0
The Garden Hideway,"A very unique concept for an Airbnb and we loved it. The idea of a living space within a home completely secluded from the main housing is something that catches the eye and this place does not fail to impress. The place was sparkling clean, the amenities were more than sufficient and the private parking space was an added bonus in a town where free parking is not easily available. A stone throws distance from Whole Foods to pick up some food and the neighborhood is lovely and we felt very safe. The only downside is that the bathroom is outside the unit albeit a private one. It was a little cold during our visit so walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night was a tad little inconvenient but this was clearly advertised in the listing so it did not come as a surprise. All in all a 5 star listing!!",Oakland,0
The Redwood Retreat - 20 minutes to downtown SF!,"My partner and I stayed in the in-law suite for 2 nights and felt very welcome from the moment we arrived. The in-law suite was homely and had everything that was needed (coffee machine, microwave, fridge, crockery and cutlery). Ian and Tenzing have created a lovely space for visitors to stay in and ensured that privacy was maintained at all times. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the telly even had a Netflix subscription which was a really nice touch. Ian was very helpful and recommended some good places to go visit whilst in San Fransisco. We would definitely stay here again!",Oakland,0
The Redwood Retreat - 20 minutes to downtown SF!,"what a stunner! i'll admit when we were driving into the neighbourhood we were a bit apprehensive, but Ian's place is an amazing oasis in the middle of the urban area. the backyard is quiet, and lovely to sit outside at night. the space is roomy, clean, and welcoming. the tv has a Fire stick on it so you can access all your favourite apps for television, along with SlingTV for regular channels. Ian was very responsive when we needed questions asked, which we really appreciated. we were even able to check in a bit early! it's very easy to get anywhere you need to go in the area from this place as well. All in all, a wonderful experience. thank you so much, Ian and Tenzing!",Oakland,0
Vintage Time Capsule,"You will love this cozy nostalgic trailer from the 1950s. Michael, Capra and Vyla are a wonderful host family! They really make you feel welcome... I stayed in the vintage time capsule for 3 months with no issues. The Laurel District is close by with plenty of cute restaurants. Lake Merritt (a 3 mile lake where plenty of people walk and ride bikes) and the Grand Theater (beautiful historic movie theater) are a couple exits away on the 580. There are also a bunch of restaurants here as well. Shopping is close by at Bay Street in Emeryville or 4th street in Berkeley (all of which Michael has laid out in a convenient welcome book) Easy to get into SF by the Bart at the Fruitvale station.",Oakland,0
Wooded In-Law,"My parents and I stayed at George & Colleen's place for a few days while visiting San Francisco and had an amazing time. The location of their place was very convenient; everyday we drove about 10 minutes to the Ferry station and just took that to get downtown. The place itself was extremely spacious, stylish and clean. My parent's slept on the bed while I slept on the sofa bed (comfiest sofa bed I've ever slept on). George and Colleen welcomed us warmly to their place and provided a lot of helpful tips that helped us navigate the city. Next time we come to San Francisco we would love to stay here again!",Oakland,0
Wooded In-Law,"What a lovely experience at George and Colleen's place! 

Colleen's communication prior to arrival was considerate, timely and thoughtful. 

When I arrived, there were delicious blueberry muffins and snacks waiting! The muffins came in a close second to the beautiful surroundings - we could only see sky and trees from the backyard and heard only birds. It was truly an oasis and exactly what we had searched for - a local getaway that made us feel like we were in the middle of nowhere without having to drive for hours out of Oakland.",Oakland,0
Wooded In-Law,"入住的体验实在太好了,我们那天飞机延误导致凌晨四点才到geroge的住处,没想到geroge没有睡一直在等我们,还超级热情的帮我们提行李介绍房间,实在非常感动｡房子的环境也超级好,干净有品味,有小院子可以bbq和烤火,是非常让人向往的小屋,房子在奥克兰,奥克兰的整体环境非常舒适,跟旧金山downtown的感觉完全相反,第一晚去check in的时候还看到了两只小鹿并肩过马路,实在太棒了,如果你看到了这个房子一定要来入住哦!
It's a wonderful experience,We didn't arrive at geroge's house until 4 o 'clock in the morning due to the flight delay. Unexpectedly, geroge was waiting for us all the time without sleeping. He also helped us carry our luggage and introduced the room with great enthusiasm. House environment is super good, clean and have good taste, it has a small yard ,you can BBQ and warm yourself by the fire, this desirable house is in oakland, the environment of oakland is very comfortable, It's completely opposite for the feeling of the downtown , the first night to check in we saw two deer crossing the road, they are so lovely, if you are coming to San Francisco,please choose geroge's house,it's  must be amazing.",Oakland,0

Bikes Beach Gear and Fun Spacious and Comfy Ocean View Room Walk to Pier,"My bf and I stayed at Scott's place for 3 nights and were very very comfortable and entertained. :) The Alexa gadget was really cool to have around, especially in an unfamiliar locale if you want to ask it questions about historic weather, population, about the forecast, and my bf needs white noise to sleep so it even does that. Pretty cool.  Scott also provided snacks in the room and lots of toiletry items in the bathroom--even sunscreen which we shoulda used. Ha. The bed slept GREAT, Scott was kind enough to allow us to use his beach chairs and laundry facilities which was very helpful and convenient.  Walking to the beach was no biggie for my bf but I will say as a heads up that if you are fat (self included), the beach is probably a tad further than you wanna walk, especially since the return walk is uphill.  We went in our rental car the 2nd time and had no trouble finding parking (and this was memorial day weekend).  Great place to stay. ☺☺☺",Redondo Beach,0

She had beach toys, chairs and bikes to use which we took advantage of. I would definitely come back to this place, the location was great in Redondo Beach, and it was great for me and my family. There were four of us and there was plenty of room. Also,  she recommended a great Italian place called Mama D’s just a five minute walk away. First class, thanks for your great hospitality! Will be back.",Redondo Beach,0
Breezy Cottage One Block from the Beach,Tiana and Derek were amazing hosts.  They were both very kind and made every effort to make our stay enjoyable.   We booked their place for a BFF reunion with our 14 year old daughters #girlsonly. The Beach Cottage is the perfect place for a couple or family to stay.  This location is close to everything and you're able to walk everywhere.  This was my first experience with an Air bnb and it far exceeded my expectations.  We will definitely be back next year ...    Nicole S. and Danelle H.  ,Redondo Beach,0

The neighborhood is beautiful and very quiet. No worries about losing sleep from any outside noises!  Additionally, my family brought our two dogs with us, and they were very cool about it.

The place was in a great location, she was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. My wife and I would definitely recommend to friends travelling to Redondo Beach.   Accessibility Note: The only thing I do want to mention, as one of the main reasons we booked this Airbnb was because it was listed as “step free”, is that there is a small step to enter the Airbnb that I was not able to independently navigate in my manual wheelchair. Still a 5 star Airbnb - but would be important for other wheelchair users to know.",Redondo Beach,0

Home Away from Home in Hermosa Beach,"This place is a total gem. Just stayed here a second time.  The room is  like a mini-studio apartment with a  tiny private courtyard.  Adorable.  I am blown away by how many thoughtful touches Tammy and Marc provide, from beach gear to a bike, to a variety of coffees in the room (and even a kettle if you are a tea person).  It is just lovely. The bed is heavenly.  The room is IMMACULATE.  And the location is fabulous.  A quick 20 minutes from LAX and you are a world away in the lovely 'surf city' Hermosa Beach.  The house itself is  about 2 blocks off the beach. Literally a 3 minute walk ( I think it takes longer to cross the wide sand beach to the ocean's edge than it does to get from the room to the beach).  I. Love. This. Place!!!  Tammy and Marc were really responsive, but also respect your privacy. Already trying to figure out my next business trip so I can stay here again.",Redondo Beach,0

The room has all it needs and is centrally located within walking/biking/driving distance to all but seems like an oasis all on its own. Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! And if you forget anything - a quick text to Tammy and Marc upstairs can solve that!

Home Away from Home in Hermosa Beach,"Great place to stay in Hermosa Beach.  Very clean and perfect location only 2 blocks from the beach.  Although the owners live upstairs this is private with it’s own entrance.  Marc and Tammy are very friendly and excellent hosts.  They have added some nice touches such as a Keurig with coffee pods, creams and sugar,  restaurant recommendations,   Blow dryer,  small fridge and microwave.  A couple things to note are that it is nice they provide bicycles,  just know that they are older.  They are fine for just a short ride down the beach but if you want to go any farther I would suggest renting some bikes.  One great thing about this area is the bike path on the beach that goes all the way to Santa Monica.  There are 2 rental places close by.  Also the owner lives upstairs and has cats.  If you are a light sleeper you can hear them walking around early in the morning.  I would not let this deter you from renting as the location,  cleanliness and gracious hosts make for a great stay.  We would definitely go back.",Redondo Beach,0

Petite Boutique,"This is a great place that puts you in walking distance to Redondo Beach. As someone visiting LA for a couple days, I wanted to be close to the beach and this place definitely had it. In fact, not only could I walk to the beach, but there is a cool outdoor courtyard that you share with Neva that is super cute. There was a little bit of maintenance trouble at the beginning of my stay (I think there was a toilet leak) so I had some unexpected visitors for about an hour while they repaired the toilet but honestly I think these things happen and everyone was very respectful. That said, just know that this is a VERY small space. It was perfect for me traveling alone but know that you basically have just the bed and a tiny bathroom. Neva does an AWESOME job though of making a small space into something great-- There was a desk to work at in one corner, a microwave, mini-fridge, and keurig in another, and then a tv with apple-tv on the other corner! Another thing that could be improved would be the WiFi... it was painfully bad. Since I was in LA for a job interview it was irritating that I couldn't even get (Hidden by Airbnb) to load at times. Overall, this is an awesome spot, particularly if you're just looking for a place to crash between LA touring and beach living!",Redondo Beach,0

We were able to Uber easily when we needed to.  Everything we needed in a place to stay was supplied by our wonderful hostess would stay there again for our next visit in the Redondo Beach area,Redondo Beach,0

Petite Boutique,Beautiful quaint place in a lovely part of Redondo Beach.

Petite Boutique,"Fantastic stay! Highly recommended. I loved my time at Neva's beach bungalow. Neva greeted me warmly with her super sweet doggie. I felt (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was easy and clear. Neva's place was cozy and very clean. Neva also had thoughtful extras such as a basket of travel items in case guests forgot something - which I did so I appreciated the lotion. Thank you! There was also shampoo and conditioner in the shower as well as a coffee area and fridge. She has a air conditioning unit as well as space heater which was perfect. The bungalow is wonderfully located a few blocks from the beach and close to shops, restaurants, and groceries. It was very convenient for me to get around the south bay. It is about a fast 10-15 minute drive to LAX, but beware of internal airport congestion once inside the airport. I would definitely stay at Neva's again. It was ideal for me. The yard is beautiful and a great place to hang out. The bathroom is cozy and stylishly decorated with a wonderful shower and sink. Thanks again, Neva!",Redondo Beach,0

Petite Boutique,Neva's place is great for the Redondo beach/Hermosa beach area. As long as you are ok walking for about 15 minutes or taking a short Uber the location is great and the guest house is definitely worth the value. I am relatively small so the place was fine for me but someone larger/taller may have some issues with the house as it is pretty compact. Otherwise Neva was awesome and I'd definitely recommend the place!,Redondo Beach,0
Petite Boutique,Great place and super nice host (loved the dog). The patio was peaceful to unwind and giant closet space was helpful to keep stuff out of the way. Location excellent to Hermosa and Redondo and nice not to have to search for parking!,Redondo Beach,0

The living space was perfect for my teenage daughter and me. Parking was available all times of day in front of house. Neighborhood was quiet.  Those who are worried about dogs. Neva’s dog, Logan, does not jump on people when greeting them. He is well behaved.  My favorite part of my stay is that Neva had small amenities (q-tips, cetaphil face wash, sunblock, aloe vera, coffee, notepad and pen). Stuff you might need but never think of.  Easy check-in too!!",Redondo Beach,0

He allowed us to check in a bit earlier than expected due to our flight coming in a bit earlier and personally walked us through the place and all the aspects of it. He left a ha du guide for us to follow of the local places to visit. This is a return trip for us and we were unaware of some of the new kings in the area. He allowed us the use of bikes - which saved on rentals - and even replaced on of the bikes that had a flat. He really went out of his way to make us feel welcome.   We’d be happy to return to his place anytime we visit Redondo or Manhattan Beach.,Redondo Beach,0

The location is great with a short walk to Trader Joe’s, coffee shops and restaurants and a Farmer Market that we visited on Sunday.

Relax In Redondo Beach with Ocean Breze,"Elizabeth was super accommodating to our schedule for check-in.  She responded to questions and requests in a very timely and upbeat manner.  The room itself is bigger than I expected, which was nice as my husband ended up needing to do some work.  The room had a desk space and we weren't on top of each other while he worked and I relaxed and read.  The bathroom is extra spacious with two sinks and a big, walk in shower.  I enjoyed having an outdoor balcony to sit and enjoy a morning cup of coffee.  Elizabeth's place is tucked into a neighborhood, but walking distance to the harbor and beach.  We also walked to a great pancake place about 1/2 mile south on PCH (Wildflower Cafe, I believe).  We felt this spot was a super value and we would come back to it the next time we find ourselves in the area. And I highly recommend a low-key bike ride up and down The Strand.  I don't know if it would be too hectic in the busy summer months, but it was a perfect way to laze-away a sunny spring afternoon.",Redondo Beach,0

"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","Heather was a fantastic host, and her home on the beach is absolutely perfect. I was a single traveler looking to stay a little out of the hustle and bustle of a tourist spot. Ocean Beach is the perfect place for that! Just steps from the beach, but close enough to any sights to see in San Francisco, I couldn't have asked for a better location. The home itself is perfect, equipped with a kitchen, sitting room, bedroom and bathroom. Not to mention the gardens around the home are stunning. Heather was very communicative and welcoming, and had an answer to any question I had. I will absolutely be returning to San Francisco, and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!",San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","Heather’s place is just as pictured and is in a beautiful, scenic location right across from Ocean Beach. She had a nice bottle of wine & some yummy chocolates waiting for us on arrival. She was easy to communicate with and always available with a quick response. We had everything we could possibly need and more. Her place is beautifully decorated, clean and very comfortable. We enjoyed the private outdoor patio area right outside the bedroom. And the Apple TV was a nice amenity to have. We would definitely stay here again!",San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","If you are looking for a homely, tranquil place by the beach away from the hustle & bustle of the city this is the perfect place. The apartment is spotlessly clean, homely and has everything you need to relax and enjoy your break. Heather is a great host and has lots of information / guide books plus personal tips to suggest if you need help. 
The apartment is 5 minute walk to the train which takes you directly into the city and they run every 10 minutes. The area is fantastic , residential , quiet but still lots of great places to eat at half the price of downtown. The beach is an amazing 4 mile stretch which is great for walking & just taking in the gorgeous views / sea air. (It’s not a swimming beach ). 
After a 3 week road trip staying in lots of places, Heathers apartment was the by far the best and I hope to return someday. Thank you ❤️",San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","Heather is a warm, thoughtful host who offers the visitor a clean and inviting apartment that stands out from the rest because it has a patio garden off the bedroom with beautiful flowers and trees.  A little bistro table invites you to enjoy your morning coffee, while on the kitchen table a bottle of wine, some chocolate, and fresh cut flowers welcome your arrival.  The apartment is comfortable, clean, and located right across the street from the ocean. It is within easy reach of public transportation into the heart of the city, but it is far enough away from the city to offer a quiet respite from the hubbub of San Francisco.  We loved our time there and highly recommend this apartment.",San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","Heathers apartment was exactly as I expected it to be, it is exactly as pictured, clean and aired. The location was ideal for us, we didn’t want to stay downtown we wanted chilled and slower which is exactly what we got. Having the beach directly across the road was icing on the cake and there are some great coffee shops locally. The metro is also just a few minutes walk and can get you to pretty much anywhere you want, there are also bus stops dotted around to get you to the zoo etc very quickly. We found everyone (including Heather) to be extremely helpful to the extent that when we got off the bus we found drivers would often get off with us and talk us through where we would need to go to be picked back up again. Heather was the most accommodating host, we stayed for 11 nights and she ensured the place was cleaned for us during our stay and we used her washing machine and dryer as we tried to pack light. I would 100% go back and stay again. The only thing I would mention is not to bother buying your own guide book of San Francisco, there are loads in the apartment to use with local maps and Heathers own recommendations. Thank you letting us stay with you, it was perfect. ",San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach",Would highly recommend this Airbnb! Quiet neighborhood but not far from the heart of the city. Heather provides everything a traveler needs and more and loved the complimentary bottle of wine. It was delicious! Apartment is beautifully decorated and such a beautiful patio. As a runner I enjoyed having the running/walking path that runs parallel to the ocean. And I would recommend the Java Beach Cafe for breakfast. We walked down there two mornings for breakfast. Would definitely stay here again if I’m in the area.,San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","Heather’s space is beautiful. Super comfy bed. Kitchen with all the basic requirements. Spacious living area with ‘Netflix-ready’ television. Right next to the beach. Heather was very accommodating and helpful despite being away on a camping trip for the majority of our stay. I would 100% use her apartment if I returned to San Francisco again. 


Other useful  info for guests: 

Street parking right outside, free and plenty - unavailable for certain hours in the week due to street cleaning, check beforehand. 
Heather’s apartment is full of detailed information on local restaurants etc.
Washing and drying facilities on the property. 
Uber/Lyft is cheap and easy to get to all the main parts of the city.",San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","Heather’s place was fantastic. It’s in a great location for exploring the city, yet getting away from the hassle and bustle in the evenings. Heather doesn’t leave you needing anything!

The book with very personal SFO advise is very useful and the spots recommended were fabulous! The coffee & personal touches through the apartment were a real bonus and we felt homely from the start! Heather is lovely and her place allowed us to explore San Fransisco feeling like a local! Thank you Heather!",San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","We spent 10 days in these charming garden apartment and what shall say....... everything is exactly as Heather describes it. It is really charming, quiet, warmly decorated, the garden is so beautiful and for your own, the beach is only 100 m away, the muni transportation system to go downtown or where ever you want is just 2 blocks away, the same with the golden gate park. Supermarkets, nice cafes and restaurants are also nearby and you really don't need a car to explore everything.
The whole package is 1+++.
What can I say about heather... she is really a super host !!!!!!!

One example: In our case, we arrived there after an 18 hour journey .
The entrance to the house is as simple as Heather describes it.
You get in and feel.. wow that's it. You open the very good California wine which stand there  as an welcome offer, you sit down in the garden stretch your legs und are ...... yes at home or just arrived .


Go there and be prepared to feel like being at home or maybe sometimes better !!!!

Ps: To buy a muni ticket for the days you stay in Sf is for me the best way to be mobile in the city. Driving with Uber or the Lyft is also an opportunity. Join the nightlife in the Academy of Sciences on every Thursday evening. It's really an experience how they get science allied with urban life style to attract the people!!!",San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","Heather's home is in a supreme location if you're looking for a section of San Francisco that is wonderfully calmer and more tender than the others while still providing lots to do and see (doesn't hurt to also be in an area where parking is easy to find!). Her shared home is beautifully decorated and we enjoyed looking through the big binder of things to check out— even me as someone who's spent seven years in the past living in this gem of a city. All in all, I don't believe you'll regret staying here!",San Francisco,0
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","Heather's place has been by far the best Air BnB experience to date! Her apartment was beautifully kept and furnished and located in a great part of town - just slightly away from the hustle & bustle but a quick muni ride into all the action which made it a perfect home base for exploring the city. 

The apartment itself, check-in process and amenities provided by Heather were all amazing and definitely above and beyond what I would normally expect. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting to visit SF - we will definitely be back!",San Francisco,0
Garden Studio With Private Entrance Near GG Park,"Chris goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The book with all the advice and transportation tips were so helpful, it made eating and getting around much easier !! Also the stocked fridge with juices, expensive granola, and toiletries provided was very much appreciated. It is located in a quiet residential part of town which really makes you feel like a local. Very close to Golden Gate park which has lots of activities. Chris is fast to respond and encourages questions. We would definitely stay here again!",San Francisco,0
Garden Studio With Private Entrance Near GG Park,"Chris’s apartment was exactly as it appears in the pictures, It is beautiful and the perfect place to come home to after a big day exploring in the city. The neighborhood feels so safe you don’t mind walking to nearby restaurants late at night.
It is so close to many amazing restaurants and cafes. Make sure you use the resource folder provided and eat at the restaurants suggested. 
Public transport into the city was no problem at all, it was about half an hour to most tourists destinations including union square, fisherman’s wharf and golden gate bridge.   
Chris and Rocky provided an amazing home away from Home in San Francisco.",San Francisco,0
Garden Studio With Private Entrance Near GG Park,"Chris is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! The place is immaculate and pictures are accurate and spacious. She provides a stocked fridge with yogurt, juice, milk, granola, tea, water, fruit, etc. This made our mornings super easy to get in a quick bite and hit the road. The second day on arrival she checked in with us to see if everything was OK. There's also a library of books regarding SF history, tours, to borrow at your disposal. Very quite and safe neighborhood. I highly recommend her place to anyone.",San Francisco,0
Garden Studio With Private Entrance Near GG Park,"We spent 3 nights at Chris’s studio apartment and think that the only valid description for both the hosts and the apartment is ‘fantastic’! Chris went out of her way to make our stay special.
The studio was spotless and provided all that we could wish for in terms of comfort and facilities, including a chance to relax in the garden and some very welcoming breakfast and other amenities. For us a special bonus was the superb location - less than 5-minute walk to the wonderful Golden Gate Park – a must visit - along with excellent transport links to other areas of the city.  
We will definitely be returning!",San Francisco,0
Garden Studio With Private Entrance Near GG Park,"Lovely place to stay during my first (hopefully, not the last) trip to San Francisco. I arrived rather late in the evening (around 9:30ish), and Chris came out to greet me and show me the place.

As a solo traveler, it’s important for me to feel safe and secure wherever I’m staying ... even more so when being so far from home.  Chris’s place definitely made me feel comfortable and at ease.

Basically, there are two doors, a hallway, and a locked gate that separate you from the street. Once inside the apartment, there are a set of doors that lead out to the garden which is also enclosed. 

The apartment was very spacious and tidy. There is a little kitchenette with a fridge, sink, and microwave. It was a nice surprise to see that the fridge was stocked with water, OJ, milk, and yogurt. 

The same can be said for the bathroom/shower which included shampoo, soap, and body wash. There was also a drawer full of travel-sized hygienic products if you happened to forget anything. 

My favorite part of the place was the mini library that included a slew of books on San Francisco. There was also a guestbook that provided you with all the info you needed to know while staying there as well as recommendations on restaurants and things to do in the area. 

Overall, I couldn’t find a single negative about the place (not that I was looking for one). I’d definitely recommend it to anyone else and also would stay again during my next visit.",San Francisco,0
Garden Studio With Private Entrance Near GG Park,"Absolutely nothing negative to say!  Perfect place to stay in SF.  Beautiful room, sparkling clean and large shower with immediate hot water, comfortable bed with high-quality linens, public transportation easily available, close to several coffee shops and yummy bakeries, easy walk to Golden Gate Park, close to Safeway, and immediate response from Chris to any request.  The view from the multiple back windows was of a lush garden, which made a relaxing spot to read or have a glass of wine.  No noise; felt very secluded even though the place was right in the middle of everything.  The breakfast items that were available to us, plus the bottled water, were very much appreciated.  I hope to stay at Chris's place when I am next in SF.",San Francisco,0
Garden Studio With Private Entrance Near GG Park,"This is a great apartment. It's super clean and comfortable, feels very private, and came stocked with breakfast items, extra tolitries, and sparkling water, all which were great touches. We enjoyed the patio/yard area. The bed was too firm for my back (though my husband loved it) and Chris graciously set up the airbed for me. She also let us stash our luggage for a few hours after checking out, which was kind and very helpful. She was a great and responsive host. 

The location is super close to Golden Gate Park, and easy to walk or bus or ride share to other parts of the city. We liked that the neighborhood feels quiet and residential but is still close to some great coffee shops and restaurants. I would recommend this spot for sure! ",San Francisco,0
Garden Studio With Private Entrance Near GG Park,"This is a GREAT AirBnb if your coming into the the San Fran area!!  Chris has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and relaxing! There were bottles of water, juices, and yogurts in the fridge. Extra towels, iron, travel size bathroom essentials in case you forgot yours and even umbrellas! Bathroom is super nice! The overall Airbnb is very spacious and very clean and has a cute flower garden out back! Chris is great at communication and gets back with you within the hour. If me and my fiancé are ever back in the area again  we will  book here again!",San Francisco,0
Garden Studio With Private Entrance Near GG Park,"I highly recommend this clean, spacious, quiet studio on the ground floor of a classic San Francisco house in the Inner Richmond District.  What you get is  (1) a large space with a comfortable sofa and bed as well as a table with 2 chairs, (2) a small, separate kitchen with a microwave, sink, and small refrigerator well-stocked with mineral water, juices, yogurt, granola and other items, (3) a bathroom with a very large modern shower, and (4) a beautiful private garden with direct access from the studio through glass doors.  The location is super -- right next to Golden Gate Park and steps away from countless first rate restaurants and bakeries.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"I have stayed at Airbnbs all over the world but this room has been by far the best. Tyler has thought of every little detail that a guest could need and has accommodated. A tv with Apple TV, white noise machine, coffee machine, bath robes, the list goes on. His Airbnb is in a great central location and close to lots of food and transportation. He was quick to respond to my questions and allowed me to drop off my luggage before check in. Will definitely stay at again next time I am in SF. Thanks Tyler!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Enjoyed our stay at Tyler's place a lot! This is really a hotel standard home but with much more thought put into every little detail, from the styling and color selections of the entire room to all the nicely designed and framed instructions and notes throughout. There is large TV, coffee machine, clean robes, slippers, and even a bottle of aspirin provided. We were surprised by the little instruction book that contains all house and neighborhood information we need to know, super detailed and graphically designed. Would highly recommend Tyler's place and would definitely love to stay here again next time we're in San Francisco.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler's place was amazing. It was a bit on the pricier side but that was because it had all of the amenities of being in a hotel. We were provided slippers, robes, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, toothbrushes along with snacks, beer and water. We had brought chargers for our phones, but those were also provided right beside the bed. The room also had an apple TV that was great for kicking back and watching something while watching dinner. It was the type of airbnb where you truly did not need to bring anything.

We showed up earlier then check in time so Tyler was great about letting us leave our stuff while we went to go explore San Francisco. He helped us to move our luggage into the room when it was ready.

The room was great - large, soft bed. Plenty of sheets and pillows. There was a desk area as well, the lights were for able to dim at certain levels for ambience lighting and the washroom lights were automatic sensors. 

Would definitely recommend if you don't mind staying a bit farther out - it's still really only around 5-10 dollar uber/lyft ride back.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,I stayed at Tyler's place for a night and it felt like I was at a hotel. Tyler offered snacks and coffee in the room which was a great touch. One of my favorite things about it was the white noise machine and the black out curtains. I slept like a baby! I also really enjoyed how eco-friendly everything was; from the spa local products being kept in glass bottles instead of plastic in the restroom to the ability to dim the lights and conserve energy. I will definitely be booking with Tyler again in the future!,San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"We had a great stay at Tyler's place!  The room feels like a really nice hotel room with every thoughtful amenity you could imagine.  The fridge was even stocked with local beer and cold beverages. Tyler provides next level customer service with directions for every single thing you might have questions on at his place. The room itself is cozy for two people but plenty of space for what we needed. The bed is very comfy and we really appreciated the charging stations on either side. The communal space upstairs is gorgeous! If you have a rental vehicle, parking can be a bit tricky on the streets, especially late at night.  During the day we didn't have much trouble finding a place to park. We would definitely recommend this place and neighbourhood. Precita Park Cafe is 2 blocks away and the coffee & breakfast sandwiches are amazing!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"We had an excellent stay at Tyler’s place.
By the time we arrived in San Francisco, we were a bit tired from our road-trip from Vancouver, and so it was a real treat to have such a clean place with complimentary snacks, beer, and HBO/Netflix for our first night. 

In terms of the neighbourhood, we were in walking distance to the Latino Cultural District with excellent restaurants, cafes, and bakeries. We enjoyed Frutilandia and the Spice Jar, but there were so many options.

Also worth mentioning is the access to a washer and dryer - when you’re away from home for almost 2 weeks, it’s beyond helpful to be able to have a chance to do some laundry and have more clean clothes.

Thanks Tyler for setting up a very lovely place for guests!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"When traveling I prefer Air BNB to hotels. Yet for all you gain from a home stay sometimes you sacrifice a little of the crisp cleanliness and amenities of a professional environment. Not so at Tyler's spot! Not only was it lovely to be in a home in a neighborhood, but the room was like a lux hotel suite! Tyler has gone above and beyond thinking of ways to make our stay comfortable; a comfy bed, a sparkling room, lovely bath amenities, and snacks. It was great and I would recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco who is ambulatory. I say ambulatory because Tyler's place is on a steep street and you will need to climb stairs to his entry- so you have to be able to walk/climb. Also, because this place is on the outer limits of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation in the neighborhood. I found parking in that neighborhood to be quite accessible. On my last morning there I had a lovely coffee at the Precita Park cafe which is very close...the food being served looked tasty. Next time I'll eat there! Highly recommended.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Let’s start with communications with Tyler was quick, simple, and clear. I can tell that he takes much effort into making sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. We got free slippers, the most comfortable bed, and a private bathroom as well. There is a refrigerator, desk, tv, and travelers information about getting around San Francisco. Basically anything we will need during our stay. The place was very clean, stylish, and homely. I will definitely stay here again the next time! Thank you again!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Amazing deal and great stay. The check in process is with a code to the house. The guest room is private on the bottom floor with a full bath connected to the inside of the room. The room is spotless with coffee, snacks, 2 beers (great after a long drive), bath robes, slippers, tooth brushes, soaps, and other toiletries. The house is very modern and the nicest one on the block! The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. Tyler stays on the third floor of the house. Free parking on the street  and we were always able to find a spot. One night, Tyler saved us a spot and moved his car to the street and told us to text him when we arrived so he could give us his spot. We drove from the house to downtown SF and it was about a 25 minute drive with traffic. We also ubered to pier 39 and it was about $10. Highly recommend Tyler’s place!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler's attention to detail in the room and to his guests really shows he cares about the guests that stay. He has little notes around the room and house explaining how to use everything, which was a great help. Check in is super easy and there is unlimited parking on the street out the front but be aware that its one steep street (like the rest of San Francisco) also if you give up your parking spot especially in the afternoon you might have to park a couple of blocks away for the night and then move your car in the morning. Over all it's a very comfortable, clean and homely stay.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Words cannot describe just how spectacular our stay with Tyler was and is without a doubt the best Airbnb stay that we have ever had. 

The space was just perfect for our needs - clean, bright and warm - and allowed us to spend our week across the world as relaxed as possible. Tyler has clearly put a lot of effort into ensuring his place feels like a hotel, but to be honest it didn’t feel like a hotel, it felt so much better - a home. 

Tyler provided us with all the space we required but was also available for any questions and tips as we needed them and after meeting him and his partner we feel like we now have a couple of new lifelong friends. 

Don’t stay anywhere else in ‘San Fran’ - just stay here, you won’t regret it.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"This was our favourite Airbnb yet! The hospitality from Tyler was incredible. Great communication and ease of check in. The location is great too - near lots of bar and restaurants

The room has so many personal touches and Tyler has thought of every small detail from iPhone chargers, bath robes to ear plugs. The shower was equipped with beautiful smelling products. The style of the room is super  cool too - it feels like staying in a room at the ace hotel.

We only had two days to explore SF so we only used this room as a base but would love to have spent more time here.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler has thought of every detail to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable experience.  The house was impeccably clean, the room was quiet and private, the check in was seamless and convenient.  He was quick to respond to any questions, of which I had very few since he anticipated most of my questions up front.  No detail is too small for Tyler, even down to having chargers ready on both sides of the bed.  You will not be disappointed or feel misled if you stay with Tyler.  It really is as good as it looks!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler has thought of everything in this great apartment. From eco friendly toiletries, to bedside chargers and snacks, the space is cleverly designed and filled with personal touches to make you feel at home. It feels private and secure and is located in a nice little neighbourhood which, while being out of the main tourist centre, is close enough to lots of bars and restaurants and is a short Uber or bus ride into the centre. The welcome pack was really helpful and we had a nice brunch at one of Tyler’s recommended spots. What a fantastic start to our US road trip. ",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. Even though you only book a room, it is still very completely private. Most of the time we had the place completely to ourselves. However when we met Tyler, he welcomed us so nicely and provided us with a lot of tips on where to eat and what to do. The place itself is nothing short of amazing. Beautifully decorated, sparkling clean and so perfectly located. One of the things we liked best was the outstanding view of San Francisco, especially from the balcony on the second floor! There were also little surprises of snacks and drinks that awaited us when we came in which was awesome. Seriously, if you’re ever in San Francisco, you simply have to book this place! ",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"We stayed at Tyler's place to visit San Francisco at the end of our roadtrip through the states. When we arrived we were allready briefed on how to check in and we also recieved some guidelines. Once inside we were amazed on how clean the whole house (including the private bedroom and bathroom) is! Everything you could possibly need was available and more! Later that day we met Tyler and his partner. They were very friendly and we had a good talk about our trip, traffic, places to see and where to get different kinds of food. We asked for mexican food and they immediately gave 3 different addresses from ""hole in the wall"" to ""fancy"". We are very happy to have stayed there, and so we recommend Tyler's place to everyone! ",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler's place is absolutely wonderful.  On entering the house the first thing you see is your beautiful room with the very impressive welcome booklet. Absolutely amazing! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we are looking forward to returning to San Francisco and enjoying his hospitality.  Tyler's knowledge of San Francisco is second to none.  Whatever you are looking for he will be able to help you find it.  All of the recommendations he provided were first rate.  When looking  for our accommodation in San Francisco there were so many choices, we are very glad we picked Tyler's place. It's very easy to get to the main attractions using public transport or you can walk to Mission and explore all the wonderful murals in the neighbourhood.  Highly recommended. ",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Just perfect. The place was easy to find, with enough places to park. Check in was so smooth, and we were taken away with how much thought had been made in every possible way. The mini fridge had beverages and snacks, which we particularly enjoyed after our long journey. The space was beautiful with a real relaxing atmosphere. It was a reasonable 20 minute walk to mission district where we were spoilt for choice in food and bar options. I would definitely recommend and definitely consider staying again. ",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Stepping into Tyler’s apartment was like walking into a luxurious hotel, but better. He really has thought of everything and has equipped the room and en-suite with all the necessities for guests. The highlights being the delicious coffee machine, locally-sourced soaps and the very comfortable bed.

The apartment is well located and is in walking distance to the trendy Mission District. Tyler has a lot of useful tips to share for tasty restaurants and bars. 

Would definitely like to stay again, and would highly recommend that you do.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"We were so lucky to find this cozy Airbnb. Though we do enjoy meeting our hosts and sharing a space, this one truly was more private than we expected. That being said, San Francisco kept us on the run and didn't give us a chance to meet our hosts, but that's okay, because they set up the space perfectly and it needed no additional explanation. They placed comprehensive and stylish signage (and a cute book!!) around the space that took care of any questions we might have had. The location and view was also just as excellent as advertised. We were able to walk down through The Mission and find some delicious restaurants. I highly recommend Farmhouse Kitchen: wowowowow. If you're looking for a spot to stay, there's a reason this is Airbnb is a plus location and we'll gladly vouch for our experience. ",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler is an excellent host. He worked hard to make sure April and I had everything that we needed, which exceeded our expectations. Tyler spoke to April and I to see what our interests were in food and entertainment then proceeded to make suggestions for food in the Mission District, as well as other places around San Francisco. Our main reason for visiting the area was to attend an Oakland Raiders game. Tyler’s room was about a 20 minute flat walk to the 24th street mission BART station which was very convenient. The touches both in the room and around the condo were warm and inviting and I know that I made the right decision to stay in Tyler’s AirBnB!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"We just had a two night stay at Tyler’s place and it was our favourite Airbnb experience to date. It offers all the benefits of being in a hotel but is so much more personal and, the most important thing, you get great insider tips on where to go during your stay. Communication was great, Tyler gave a ton of amazing recommendations. 

Location is also a plus, it’s in a great area of SF that has a great vibe - lots of places to eat, drink and shop. When we explored beyond the Mission district, we took Ubers pretty much everywhere (super easy) but I’m sure public transport would’ve been equally convenient.

The room has everything you need - EVERYTHING! Hairdryer, straighteners, mini fridge with complimentary drinks and snacks, amazing bath and hair products, even phone chargers on both sides of the bed. The bed was the most comfortable bed both my partner and I have ever slept in. The living area upstairs is beautiful, with an amazing view of SF from the balcony. 

Tyler and his partner were both very hospitable, even invited us to have a glass of champagne when Tyler’s family came over to visit. You definitely don’t get that experience in a hotel! 

We have no negatives about this place, it really is a unique experience - we have stayed in some pretty unique Airbnbs before, this one tops them all.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler's place is amazing. Considering the fact that there aren't that many hotels outside of downtown SF, this Airbnb is better than having a hotel in the neighborhood of Bernal Heights. I was able to easily Lyft to my favorite go-to spots in SF. There are a lot of things to walk to as well just west of the home. The decor and amenities of the bedroom were awesome. I enjoyed using the AppleTV and playing music while I got ready to go out. The main living areas were just like the pictures and the view from the home was awesome. I wouldn't mind coming to just hang out there and have dinner and a drink, maybe next time when I can stay longer than a weekend. Tyler was also very quick to help me out when I was having issues getting into the home.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Very clean, high tech room with a super comfy bed, really nice shower. Met our needs perfectly as it was within easy walking distance of our son. Excellent communication with host and super clear instructions about access to the place. Although we didn’t really use the shared space  we checked it out and it is lovely with spectacular views of the city. Only possible drawback for some guests is that the stairs are quite steep and numerous so carrying a large or heavy suitcase could be a challenge.

Overall, would stay here again on another trip to SF!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"This was the first time we have stayed in a host’s home so we were a bit nervous about it but Tyler made us feel completely comfortable and welcome in his home. 

The room is exactly as pictured and had loads of thoughtful touches and was a true home away from home. The bed was super comfortable and we slept peacefully every night.

The apartment is a short walk away from bus stops that are about a 20 minute ride from downtown. We much preferred being out of the city and away from the hustle and bustle. 

Tyler himself is very accommodating and gave us loads of useful tips on our first day of how to get around, useful apps and even gave us great recommendations for what we should do on our first day. (Which we decided to do and ended up being our favourite day in San Francisco). 

We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again without hesitation. Thanks for everything Tyler!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"This is an amazing find in a city crowded with excellent listings. The room itself comes with hotel-level amenities, privacy and security. Check-in was seamless and Tyler's done a fantastic job adding small touches that make a big difference. The rest of the apartment is just as welcoming. I was able to get some work done in the common space while taking in the skyline. Even had a quick chat with Tyler, who shared some great local recommendations. 

I'll definitely be looking to stay here again on my next trip to San Francisco, you should too.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Amazing place to stay in SF, well-decorated modern house, with a perfectly connected AI system using Siri to control everything in the house, we were so impressed, and they have a full collection of Whiskey and an adorable aquarium. We met Tyler and his partner on the first night, they were both really kind. The guest room is on the first floor with our own bathroom which is very separate from the sharing space so that we enjoyed good private time. The location is very not close to the attractions of SF, but with a lot of cafes around, so still very convenient to live here, and taking Uber to anywhere is also easy to manage.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"My husband and I had a lovely stay and really appreciated how well stocked the space was. For example,  I’m a light sleeper, so I was thrilled to find a white noise machine by the bedside. Tyler took the time to give us personalized food recommendations, which led us to great neighborhood spots we wouldn’t have found by relying on Yelp alone. As someone who commutes by foot regularly, I thought it was easy to walk to the Mission District and the BART. The only thing I didn’t love was not having a lock on our bedroom door, though we had no trouble during our stay.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"As all the other reviews say, wow. The experience here is truly seamless-- Tyler is immensely thoughtful, super responsive and considerate. I can't recommend staying here enough. I was in town for grad school studies, so was out all day, and it was a great retreat to return to each night. I logged some hulu/netflix hours and loved the cozy bathrobes in the closet :) The bed is super comfortable, and there's every amenity you could think of. A fantastic alternative to overpriced/disappointing SF hotels for business travel.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Our stay at Tyler’s was brilliant. The apartment is stunning and welcoming, the room is spacious with every amenity you can think of. The apartment is located within walking distance of mission district and with good bus links to the city centre and park areas. Tyler and his partner were warm and friendly and happy to help with advice and suggestions of places to go. We really loved our stay at Tyler’s and would happily recommend the apartment to other visitors. Thank you so much for your amazing hospitality.",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler has done an exceptional job of curating a beautiful and peaceful space for his guests. He has thought through every single detail imaginable - light dimmers + multiple controls for ease of use, white noise machine + ear plugs, complimentary snacks + beverages, slippers + robes - he has anticipated his guests' every need in order to make a stay in his home feel truly special.

Tyler has also provided explanatory notes for everything, making it very easy for guests to immediately feel comfortable upon arrival. However, if any question or request does come up - he was available 24/7 to chat with directly. 

Tyler's home was perfect for my quick trip in SF and I hope to stay here again if I visit in the future. Thank you Tyler!!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Both the room and location are wonderful, it really is like a hotel experience only more stylish and there was a sofa (very comfortable) nearby if you don't want to sit on the bed. Speaking of the bed, it's really comfortable and perfect for resting after a day of hiking the hills of San Francisco, and Tyler provides multiple sheet options for you which is a nice touch. It is also worth mentioning the view which is something else, from both the bedroom and the living room. On a clear day you can see from Twin Peaks right across to the skyscrapers of the financial district and everything in between.
Tyler is a super friendly host, and has plenty of tips for places to visit in the local area. He also responds quickly when you have any questions.
The Mission District has a great selection of bars, cafés, and restaurants. We mostly stuck to Valencia Street which is the trendier area and ate down there two of the five nights we stayed. Transport links for further away are great too, with a 25 minute bus ride into the city centre a mere 2 minute walk from the house. There's also a BART station not too far away, but we never needed to use it.

Overall it was a great stay, and really was like the hotel experience in Tyler's home which is quite impressive, especially since you'd be paying a far higher rate for the hotel equivalent and it would be far less personalised. Would definitely stay again!",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"This place is just as incredible in real life as it is in the pictures! I was afraid it was too good to be true, but I assure you, it really is that amazing! :) The place is impeccably decorated and our hosts were so welcoming! We spent most of our days out exploring (spending a lot of time in the Mission district), but we were always excited to return to our room. The bed was very comfy, the amenities were perfect, and we really enjoyed the community space for winding down at the end of a long day. I can’t recommend this place enough! My boyfriend was initially nervous about our stay (he’s never stayed at an Airbnb with a host on the premises), but after our first night, he said this was the absolute best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at. We felt super lucky to have found this place! Thank you for hosting us! We really loved our time here! :)",San Francisco,0
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler has put much thoughts and efforts into the overall experience & added extras (e.g. extension chords/chargers, female toiletries, night light etc) which makes one feel as though they never left home. Check in was fast and easy with clear instructions. 

It is as good as shown in the photos, if not better. Tyler is also very friendly (he's definitely up for chats, & has good recommendations for places to visit in SF) and accommodating,  allowing me to leave my luggages at a corner when I travelled out to another city for 2 days. 

All I can say is over here, you can expect a quality stay. Could not have imagined it any better.",San Francisco,0
Mission Dolores Suite,"Had a great stay!  Though I never met Marc in person, he was quick and clear with communication.  Check-in was a breeze.  This apartment is ideally located.  Close to many restaurants in the Mission and Castro.  A block away from Dolores Park!  About 10 min walk to the 16th St BART, which is convenient if traveling to and from airport.  Apartment is cozy, clean, and with all needed amenities. The building itself is pretty quiet, though I’d recommend ear plugs for sleeping if you’re sensitive to any street noise (passing cars etc).  Overall, would highly recommend!!",San Francisco,0
Mission Dolores Suite,"You will simply love the location of this home. You are located one of the coolest areas in San Francisco, Mission Delores in the Castro district and there is so much to see & so many places to eat. There is even a killer coffee shop right on the corner. 

The unit is basically made up of the bedroom, the hallway where you’ll find the Keurig coffee machine, a small wine fridge, I believe a microwave and a nice bathroom. This unit is for sleeping and (Website hidden by Airbnb) not like you’re going to sit inside in roomy comfort. 

It’s bright, clean and Marc supplies you with just about everything you need, to have a nice, comfortable stay. 

We live in a very quiet neighborhood in Phoenix so the noise out on the street, definitely caused us to not have as restful of a night’s sleep as we had hoped. Our night was garbage night and the process by the city sanitation workers out on the street, was fairly involved & loud. 

The morning commute traffic was also something we had to contend with after a late night out on the town. 

This is urban living and unless you’re use to it, we would highly suggest you bring ear plugs. 

Keep in mind, this is the price you pay for sleeping in the center of it all and with ear plugs, you should be golden & it will be worth it!!

This was the perfect place for us and we highly recommend Marc’s unit. 

Enjoy!!!

Mission Dolores Suite,"Marc's place was perfect for our 2 night stay in San Francisco . It was exactly what we needed as a launching pad to explore the city. The place was clean, checkin and checkout were very easy, communication was prompt and detailed, and the location was perfect - we were able to walk pretty much everywhere that we wanted to see. We also really appreciated the option for day parking passes since we had our car with us and didn't want to move it since we were out and about on foot the whole time. Thanks again for a great stay, Marc!",San Francisco,0
Mission Dolores Suite,"I LOVED this place. It is PERFECTLY located. It is small yet brilliantly efficient. I wish I could have given 7 stars for entry because the lockbox and door code were the easiest getting in I have ever experienced. 

Inside was soooo clean. Beautiful Bathroom. Comfy bed. Light space. GREAT Tv. 

The bedroom is on the street side so u may hear cars but it is not like NYC with honking and screeching. I had no problem sleeping. 

There is a small fridge, microwave, and Coffee maker. Plenty for a visit. 

There are some ingenious details to this apartment that I will let u discover on your own. But I loved it. 

The location is sooo perfect. Dolores park is spectacular. Steps away. Also steps away was Linea Coffee. Truly the best Oatmilk latte I have had in a long time. 

This was a great airbnb. - Steve",San Francisco,0
Mission Dolores Suite,"The Mission-Dolores Suite provided the perfect home base for exploring all that the Bay Area has to offer along with an easy walk to neighborhood restaurants, coffee shops, parks, nightlife and public transportation. The space itself is clean and calming and looks exactly like the photos. It is ideal for the single traveler and couples. It would also work well for two good friends traveling together who don’t mind sharing a queen bed and the close-ish- but comfortable- quarters. Marc and Noom were wonderful hosts. I would love to stay in their beautiful suite again on my next visit to San Francisco.",San Francisco,0
Mission Dolores Suite,"Marc's place is like everything you want from a boutique hotel with none of the bother of dealing with other guests or the awkward encounters that sometimes come with them. It offers a beautiful queen-sized room with a street view, a spa-like bathroom (super fluffy towels, lavender shower products..), and a small station with a microwave, coffee machine,  kettle, and plates for all your lite bite needs. It also has good and easy to control heat, which was a welcome respite from the cold rainy weather during my stay. There's one short flight of stairs, so you've got to be okay with that, but the building has a kind of Baker Street charm and the location is great. About a 10 min walk from the BART and a short stroll to lots of neighborhood spots.",San Francisco,0
Mission Dolores Suite,"Very clean apartment; convenient location. It's quite small, essentially a bedroom and the front hallway and bathroom. I was the only person in the apartment which was fine; good for a few days stay. A couple would need to be close to be comfortable, in my view. Having the refrigerator and microwave was handy. I had no issue with street noise as some other renters commented. Arrival instructions were simple and having the lockbox for entrance and the combo door lock made it easy for arrival and departure. It all worked very well for me.",San Francisco,0
Mission Dolores Suite,"PERFECT place to say in SF. I didn't interact with the host bcs you just let yourself in and then it's a totally private little studio, so I didn't get to meet Marc but the place itself was fantastic.  Super clean. Entry is easy with coded lock - location is excellent, close to Dolores Park, BiRite market and Pizzeria Delfina and so many other great walkable places between the Mission and Castro. It's such a nice touch to have the coffee maker, kettle, and mini fridge. When people are traveling, we don't really get to bring home leftover from restaurants bcs there's nowhere to put them- so a mini fridge is such a nice touch. Great bathroom amenities! Really everything you need. I come to SF a lot and this will absolutely be on my return list!",San Francisco,0
Noe Valley Garden Ste Private Entry,"Peg and Jeff’s place was wonderful. Check in was easy and Jeff was very welcoming, telling us what was around the local area - he even brought us some milk! The apartment itself is lovely, clean and cosy - I don’t think the photos do it justice. It was fully equipped - Peg and Jeff have thought of everything, including snacks. The area was great - quiet and relaxing but with some nice restaurants nearby and close to public transportation, and the Castro and Mission districts. Overall a brilliant stay.",San Francisco,0
Noe Valley Garden Ste Private Entry,"Wonderful hosts and very comfortable guest suite in Noe Valley. It was sparkling clean and stocked with everything you’d need from keurig coffee and granola bars to maps and information about the city. Jeff and Peg were always quick to respond to messages and were very accommodating the entire stay. I appreciate their recommendations for the area and their help carrying my luggage up the hill and back from where I parked. Love that there is street parking! I ate at an awesome neighborhood restaurant Ardiana, great prosciutto di parma pizza and a yummy glass of C&C Pinot Noir :) All in all, great location, nice people, super clean and comfortable, safe, and a fair price (hard to find in SF!). I would recommend their place and I hope to stay again sometime. ",San Francisco,0
Noe Valley Garden Ste Private Entry,"Peg and Jeff’s place was absolutely beautiful. Such a great location and is really central to everything. Home was so clean, they even accommodated an early check in for us and was kind enough to message us in advance. Their home had such beautiful, thoughtful touches that we really enjoyed! It was clean, the view was absolutely beautiful and it was so comfy. I would definitely come back and stay here again!! Jeff even allowed a 45 mins late check out because we had a last minute meeting that we needed to finish before leaving.

Noe Valley Garden Ste Private Entry,"Peg and Jeff's place was charming and exactly as pictured! Their lower level suite was spacious, clean, and filled with natural light.

Peg and Jeff were very responsive and communicated with us on the day of our arrival and to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. They provided a folder with tourist information, a listing of local restaurants, and instructions on how to get round town. The location was fabulous! We highly recommend staying at Peg and Jeff's place. ",San Francisco,0
Noe Valley Garden Ste Private Entry,"Had a wonderfull stay. Noe Valley is the best area when you dont want the hustle and bustle from Fishermens Warff. 

The appartment is really spacious and you even have a beautifull and nice smelling garden.

Pegg made us homemade chocolade chip cookies and left it at the appartment when we went out.

They have good tips for the area too. Nice and comfy bed!

Noe Valley Garden Ste Private Entry,"I live in SF and got this place for my parents when they were visiting. They absolutely loved it. It’s very open and airy with lots of light. We spent time on the porch drinking coffee and enjoying the sun. There were lots of nice touches like the jelly bean dispenser, plenty of k-cups and small snacks. The fireplace and ample tv options were also great. This was a quick Uber to the mission where we went out for food and drinks. It’s also located in a quiet neighborhood so it was a nice retreat for them to come back and get a good nights sleep without the noise of the city.",San Francisco,0
Noe Valley Garden Ste Private Entry,"I had a great stay at Peg and Jeff’s place! Started with clear communication, flexible check-in, and a warm welcome. Peg provided a lot of great suggestions on surrounding restaurants and pointed out close by places like Billy Goat Hill (which is just up the street and has great views). It’s a very convenient location- walkable, close to muni stops, and easy to get a lyft. The place itself is also very spacious with a great back patio and beautiful high ceilings and skylights! Would definitely stay again!",San Francisco,0
Noe Valley Garden Ste Private Entry,"I had a very quick stay at Peg and Jeff's place, but none the less, it was a fantastic one! They're space is absolutely beautiful, and so thoughtful. Incredible design, and extremely comfortable. The space is actually much bigger than I had originally thought before I arrived in person, which is usually the opposite of what I expect! The area is very safe, with lots of parking, and many things within walking distance. Peg and Jeff were quick to respond and communication was clear and precise. I loved this place and definitely recommend staying here! Again, such a lovely space. The electric fireplace was so cute and made it very cozy :) Thank you Peg and Jeff!!!",San Francisco,0
Noe Valley Garden Ste Private Entry,"What a gem of a place! And free street parking! Our hosts graciously let us check in early and stow our luggage due to a red eye flight. So kind. Noe Valley is a lovely starting point to SF exploration. We spent an entire day walking around the Mission and Castro districts—both within easy walking distance. If you get nice weather, don’t forget to check out Dolores Park for some insane people watching...also a close walk or bus ride. The space itself is warm and inviting with an excellent back porch. There’s great coffee and snacks provided as well. We loved our stay!",San Francisco,0
Perfectly located Castro,"Brenda was great to communicate quickly and timely. The guest room is set up with helpful guides about walking San Francisco or visiting the Golden Gate Bridge. I left her house each day and walked to all my destinations (although ambitious, it can totally be done from this location). She also had a helpful ""where to eat"" handout on the desk when I got there. She was friendly and went the extra mile to make sure all the technicalities were in place, and I found the small bed to be comfortable because I slept like a rock! Would totally recommend.",San Francisco,0
Perfectly located Castro,"Brendas Location is a nice, clean and cosy little room in a lively area of san francisco. I was cordially received and hosted from her during the whole stay. The area around the location has many restaurants and is safe. Public transport to downtown (MUNI) and airport (BART) is reachable with a short walk. The historic Streetcar (Line F) to Fishermans Wharf is also in walking distance from brendas location. All in all I had a perfect stay in Brendas AirBnB room, I can recommend her location highly.",San Francisco,0
Perfectly located Castro,"Brenda’s place is the perfect location for a single person. The value is unbeatable, especially compared to other places (Airbnbs/hotels alike) in San Francisco. It’s a nice older home, located in a good area, within walking distance to plenty of awesome places. Brenda had good suggestions and was very helpful with any questions I had. I was able to experience a nice mix of exploring and downtime during my stay. (Also, as a light sleeper I actually slept just fine with the white noise machine on — that was much appreciated). Overall I enjoyed my stay and I’d definitely stay there again if I find myself out in SF as a single lady again in the near future. :)",San Francisco,0
Perfectly located Castro,"My first trip to San Francisco would not have been the same if I had stayed anywhere but Brenda’s. “Perfectly located” is not an understatement- her house is in the middle of the Castro and walking distance to fantastic nightlife and food. Brenda is more than accommodating. She makes you feel welcome, offers tips and advice for exploring the city and will go out of her way to make sure you feel at home (like giving me an umbrella for when the weather worsened). The room I stayed in was perfect for the solo traveler. Sheets were clean, towels provided and the WiFi worked great. I plan on reaching out to Brenda next time I’m in the city, and you should too! I could not have asked for a better experience.",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","We stayed at Tyler’s place for only one night before heading out of town. Check in was easy with a code to the gate and easy access to the unit. Space is light, modern, and good sized. Obviously newly remodeled and has a large TV which was welcoming to us after spending multiple days in the Redwoods with no electronics! We are out while here, but the kitchen was fully furnished and would be easily used for cooking. Location is seriously second to none. Convenient access to multiple restaurants and coffee shops. Parking was as easy as it comes in San Fran. One block from the Muni which you’re going to want to use as parking everywhere else is rough. Just a few blocks from the beach and Golden Gate Park. Would highly recommend this spot!",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","This was our first time travelling to San Francisco, and we were very impressed with Tyler’s place. The location is perfect - close to transit to get to “touristy” destinations, but there is lots to see and do in the local neighbourhood as well. The beach, Golden Gate Park and lots of great restaurants (Hook Fish Co., Thai Cottage to name a few) are all within walking distance. Tyler’s place was spotless upon arrival and had everything we needed to enjoy eating in and cooking when we wanted to. We would definitely recommend Tyler’s place to friends and family and look forward to returning soon!",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","Lovely and recently renovated home in the Outer Sunset -- just a few blocks away from the beach + one of the best ""hot"" restaurants in SF (Outerlands).

Tyler is easy to communicate with and his place is exceptionally clean, well-decorated and has a new, very comfortable mattress. Bathroom is great as well -- modern, high end, clean and plenty of hot water. 

One thing to note is that this is an in-law unit (garden-level unit of a two story home) and has entry through the garage and occasionally some noise can be heard upstairs (which Tyler mentions in his description).",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","This was our first time using an Airbnb. Tyler's home was great! It was exactly how it was described. His home was very comfortable, easy to check-in, a great location, and parking was a breeze. All the amenities of our own home. Although we didn't cook at all just having that option available was comforting. When we were looking for an Airbnb the reason we liked Tylers place was because of the kitchen. I would highly recommend his place. We had a great time in San Francisco celebrating our 35th Wedding Anniversary. It is a beautiful city with spectacular views. We look forward to visiting again in the future.",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","This place is delightful. It’s very stylish and a perfect size for two. It was extremely clean and an excellent place to arrive at after three nights camping in Yosemite. We weren’t even there for 24 hours and were disappointed we couldn’t stay longer. Great for an extended stay since it has a full kitchen, but the neighborhood has lots of offering as well. It’s a great location close to the beach and the gorgeous park. Also didn’t take long to reach the airport! Definite recommend and would certainly return.",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","We stayed at Tyler's place for five days in May. The place was extremely neat, with fresh towels and linen provided, along with all the bathroom essentials. There were three of us, so we used the bed as well as the air mattress, which was very comfortable. Tyler's place is super close to the N line of the Muni, so it is very easy to get to downtown using public transport, and explore the city. There are also a few restaurants and cafes close by and the beach is just a few blocks down, along with the Golden Gate Park. Tyler was extremely responsive to my questions and requests, and it was very easy to communicate. We had a wonderful experience at Tyler's place and I would recommend it to other travellers to SF.

"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","We stayed at Tyler’s place while visiting our son who lives in ocean beach area. It was our first experience staying at an Airbnb and it did not disappoint. We had no hassle and it was like home away from home. Tyler has the place kitted out wit everything u cud possible need. A little cold in the mornings, but there is a heater there and lots of throws and blankets. The kitchen is well stocked wit tea, coffee, sugar, oil, sauces. The bathroom the same wit lots of toiletries. He has a file wit all local information about Where to eat and what to do. U are located about half an hour from the city and transportation right beside u. We enjoyed our stay wit Tyler and would recommend to anyone. ",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","We had a great time at Tylers place. It was very neat, clean and modern. We loved everything; from the comfy bed to the amazing shower and the big TV to watch movies late at night coming back from the city! Tyler is the best host we ever had, he helped us so good! He responded always directly and was very flexible too. Location is also perfect. Close to coffee bars, the beach and golden gate park. We always took an Uber to the centre (like union square or fishermans warf) because parking is really expensive in SF and the “pool” Uber ride is about 7$. 

Dont hesitate to book!!! Would absolutely recommend Tylers place.",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","Tyler’s home is the perfect spot to kick back and relax after exploring every corner of the city. Sunset (the location the home is located in San Francisco) is a low-key and safe area where you can get away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds. Being next to the muni transit system and ocean beach was amazing. If you’re visiting San Francisco for the first time I absolutely recommend staying at Tyler’s home, just make sure you check out Outerlands (across the street) for the best brunch in the city!",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","Tyler’s place is great and even if you travel with kids, 4 people can fit easily. 
Tyler replies fast to any question and finds a solution to any issue that might arise. 
The description of the apartment is very accurate and in the folder he has prepared, you can find any information you need about the apartment but also the neighborhood and useful tips for San Francisco.
This place is like a home, with all necessary amenities, bed linen, towels, a fully equipped kitchen, a washer and a dryer. 
There is a 7/11 and another store within 5 minutes walking distance so if you need anything, no need to take the car. The apartment is also accessible by public transport. 
Parking for the night is also relatively easy to find in the adjacent streets.
We are happy to recommend Tyler’s apartment.

"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","My wife and I spent 4 days at Tyler’s Airbnb and enjoyed every minute of it. We’d planned this trip for 13 years and finally got a chance to get away by ourselves without the kids and explore San Francisco. Tyler’s Airbnb is conveniently located in the west side of the city and is just a couple blocks from the beach where we got to see some amazing sunsets. There’s tons of places to eat and grab coffee, just a few blocks from the house. We had so much fun and can’t wait to come back some day. Thanks, Tyler!",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","My boyfriend and I spent a week in San Francisco to celebrate our anniversary and see his friends, so we wanted a place close to the city but also close to the beach. This place is amazing!! Tyler’s home is not only gorgeous, but super cute and comfortable. It had adorable little touches, and we especially appreciated Tyler’s home manual with food recommendations. We loved that we were able to make breakfast before going out each day, and loved how close it was to the beach. Tyler is a wonderful host! Needless to say when we come back to SF, we will stay here again! :)",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","We really enjoyed our stay. It was just the right size for our time in the Sunset Beach area, it had a lot of quaint local places to eat at, and it was super easy to use the Muni Transportation to get to all the San Francisco places we wanted to visit. The only suggestion we have would be for the upstairs neighbors to be a little quieter in the mornings. We were woken up to running at 6:00 am both mornings. We were awake, but if you are one that likes to sleep, be aware. The space is lovely, the neighborhood was fantastic and the location to Golden Gate Park and beach was wonderful. I would stay here again!",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","You can’t go wrong with Tyler’s downstairs apartment! It is the best Air bnb we have had in SF. The amenities are more than you could need or want, and the place is stylish, very functional, and super clean. We prefer this location to many other neighborhoods - Noe Valley, North Beach, Richmond, Marina, even Pacific Heights. It is great for biking and walking - not so hilly - very convenient transportation (N Judah line).  Just find a parking space and forget the car - home of Uber and Lyft, so easy! Proximity to the beach and Golden Gate Park are huge pluses! And the outer sunset has a cool bohemian thing going on. Tyler’s recommendations for places are great, definitely check some out.",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","This was my first stay in an Airbnb and I was very satisfied. Tyler provided some toiletry essentials (shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, q-tips), and there were plenty of condiments and cooking essentials (salt, pepper, other seasonings) which was unexpected. There were extra blankets, which was fantastic. The place was comfy and well styled with awesome books on San Francisco. The temperature of the place was my only complaint as there is no Central heat or air, however he provided a radiator to heat and a fan to cool. Tyler was easy to communicate with and gave good recommendations for places to eat. I would definitely stay here again.",San Francisco,0
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park",Tyler was so incredibly helpful and quick to respond. His place was the perfect spot for me and my husband. It’s exactly as pictured which was a huge plus! It was so clean and noticeably recently updated. Shampoo/conditioner/soap in the bathroom. Heater in the closest which we used because we didn’t know it’d be that cold in June! Smart TV that you can log in to your Netflix/Hulu/etc accounts. I can’t rave enough! There’s an awesome walkable vegan restaurant for breakfast/ lunch and coffee shops from his place as well as an N train stop just a block away. Tyler sent us a list of recommendations when we asked which were super helpful. We’d definitely stay here again if we come back to San Francisco! Thanks so much Tyler !,San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","This was a nice little place for a one night stay in the city. The space itself was really small (especially the bathroom) but it was nice for just one night and you better be comfortable with the person you’re staying with since it is very close quarters. Not sure if it is the hosts who live upstairs but be prepared for some noise, we heard a lot of stomping around upstairs well past midnight and up again early in the a.m. That didn’t bother us toooo much and we really appreciated the glass water bottles, option of having coffee in the morning, FULL LENGTH MIRROR is always a huge plus in my book, and a record player with actually good record options! The place is right next to a beautiful park that we walked to in the afternoon it was just really nice. Thanks for a lovely stay Angela!",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","Angela is one of a kind, such a great person and amazing host. She’s so flexible and hospitable, she really wants your trip to be fantastic. I had a photoshoot in town and flew in for one day was stressed and tired, but she made my stay so easy and really worked with me and my bags. Also her dog is such a sweet boy and her cat is so freaking cute! 

The space is absolutely gorgeous, impeccably designed, feels like home. All the little things really made me feel so comfortable (water jug filled and chilled, emergency kit just in case you forgot something, all the makings for a quick coffee and breakfast). The book of local recommendations were such a nice added bonus along with the booklet of their favorite SF public spaces. Just overall a well thoughtout and quaint Airbnb experience.",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","Had a wonderful stay at Angela’s. I was traveling for work, and this conveniently located unit had everything I needed - comfy bed, fast WiFi, a solid workspace and great bath amenities - all in a cozy unit. Great restaurants and shops are a short walk away, great views as you walk outside and the decor was also - comparable to any nice hotel. The added amenities, like the coffee and tea and the record player and collection of records were wonderful additions too! If you’re traveling solo or as a couple, this a great place to stay.",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","Angela’s place was exactly as-described, and exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for in an AirBnB for a first-time trip to San Francisco.  It was just far enough away from the crazy city bustle to be able to relax when we wanted, but yet a 5-minute walk to shops and some seriously awesome food right in Bernal (GO TO TAQUERIA CANCUN), as well as a quick (~15 min) Uber/Lyft ride away from everything we wanted to do in the city (we could go out and do things in the city and come back to change/relax/drop things off multiple times per day without wasting much time).  The place itself was very clean, and had some really nice amenities, such as a great shower, good size fridge, comfortable bed, and ever-important coffee.  All-in-all a very cool spot that’d be perfect for either personal or business travel.  Angela was also immediate with her responses, and helpful with her tips.  Highly recommended host and location!",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","Angela's place somehow embodied stylish & at home all in one. Everything is white, which I loved because that makes it easy to tell how clean it is (no worries- her place was immaculately clean). It was a 20 min drive to all the ""touristy"" things we wanted to do & a 5 min walk to the nearest bus stop. We loved the little book of suggestions that she had, also. Her TV was connected to netflix so it was nice to relax before bed while watching our favorite shows. She also has plates, cups, coffee, and oatmeal available. Although we didn't use any of it, we thought it was a nice touch. You really can't beat this place! Hotels in town are so much more expensive and don't offer all the amenities that she had. Truly a great experience! If we are in town again, we hope to find our way back there! ",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","Angela’s place was stylish, modern, clean, and provides just what I needed for my stay. The self check in process is so easy and the location of the apartment is convenient,safe and easily accessible(no need to go through gates or fences or side alleys,etc. to enter). The modern, stylish touches made me feel like I wasn’t in a a posh hotel! Angela also provided toiletries, an emergency kit in case you forgot anything and a nice guide book for things to do, and places to eat. I would recommend Angela’s place to anyone staying in that area!",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","Angela’s apartment is a perfect base to explore San Francisco from, particularly the Mission district. There’s loads and loads of great restaurants, cafes and coffee shops within walking distance from the flat, you could spend several days just exploring the local area. The apartment itself is actually slightly bigger than it looks in the pictures and is decorated beautifully. Angela was also very attentive and helpful when we had questions. This is a great place to stay if you’re visiting the city.",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","This studio is in a great location in Bernal Heights, very walkable to bars, restaurants, coffee shops, public transit, and parks. The studio is fairly small but the space is utilized quite efficiently so you have just about everything you could need. My wife and I stayed for three nights with our four month old daughter and had a great time. One note is that while the toilet has a door, I wouldn't describe it as a terribly private space. My wife and I are not bothered by a lack of toilet privacy but in case you are staying with another person, just take it into consideration! Overall, it was a wonderfully affordable option and I would stay there again and recommend it to others.",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","Angela’s place is perfect for a solo traveler or a couple. It had amazing touches (record player!) and was overall great. The only thing is there are no windows so it can get quite dark. I love fresh air so in order to air out the studio I had to leave the door open a little. Regardless, I would stay there again without a doubt. 

I left my phone charger and Angela was super helpful and let me borrow one while I bought a new one for myself. The neighborhood is amazing, just steps from the Mission but far enough to not be loud or have dirty streets.",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","This studio is small but packs a lot of punches! Every corner has something tucked away to make maximum use of the space. Very stylish set up.
The location was a true Airbnb in that you are in a neighbourhood, but still close to restaurants and BART (Mission). 
We especially enjoyed the tea/coffee/breakfast nook with its kettle!
Note that there isn't a ""bathroom"" as such as it has a separate shower and toilet only (with one sink in the nook). We had no problems with this.
If you do not have a car, San Francisco is hilly and the neighbourhood here is no exception.",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","Angela's little studio was just what I needed for 2 days in SF. The room had all the amenities you would need for a comfortable stay. Check in was simple and you can do so any time since it's a self-check-in process. It was a short walk up to Bernal Heights Park to get a pretty cool view of the city, though quite a distance from the city center - but nothing an Uber or Lyft can't help with! Angela was kind enough to let me keep my luggages at her place after check out since my flight wasn't till the evening, and it was great to have a place to change to more comfortable clothes for my long flight ahead. Would definitely stay again!",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","My sister and I had a wonderful stay in Angela's place! It is the perfect place for anyone looking to stay a few nights in San Francisco. We were both surprised with all the amenities in the place like a record player, helpful tips/attractions in San Francisco, even a coloring book, among so much else! Also street parking was always available in front of the home throughout our stay and the location of the home is super convenient and close to everything. Would definitely stay again, thank you so much Angela!",San Francisco,0
"Stylish, cozy, private studio in Bernal Heights","Angela's place was beautiful and sparkling clean. We were able to check in early so we could hit the ground running as soon as we got into SF. She provided many tips in an information packet about what to do, where to eat/ drink, and what locals would do. She even messaged me to make sure our check in went well, and gave us options for things to do that were happening that day. Angela's place has so many sweet touches, like light breakfast options, coffee, and bottled water. For our honeymoon, she even left us a bottle of prosecco in the fridge! Her place was centrally located and we were able to walk to many places in the area, or grab a quick Uber ride.
I would highly recommend Angela's place to anyone looking to stay in SF!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights before I dropped him at SFO  The space is clean and roomy (for a studio), with high ceilings, a walk in closet, large bathroom, and comfortable seating area. The weather was great when we visited, so we loved the balcony. There is a good, reasonably-priced small market with variety two blocks away, as well as several nice coffee shops and restaurants in easy walking distance. We stayed during the week and had to manage street parking, but we always managed to find a spit within two blocks. We found the pace very comfortable for a couple and would stay again if it is available the next time we are in SF.",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"If you're looking for a great place to stay, look no further! This suites location gives you a feel of what living in the city is like.  You have everything in a short walk from the door, albeit the hills make for a good workout.  Kelly is very easy to get ahold of if you need her,  and has great recommendations of things to do or food to eat around town.  This suite has the home away from home feel, with some added luxury.  When my wife and I were researching honeymoon locations, no hotel matched up to what we were looking for.  This place exceeded our expectations and then some. We will be staying with Kelly again should we come back to San Francisco.",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"Had an incredible stay at Kelly's place. The suite is massive, modern, well-outfitted and an excellent value. We were particularly impressed by the luxurious bathroom (probably the nicest of any AirBnb I've stayed in!), the private deck and the gorgeous views of Mount Sutro. Despite the tucked away location in the relatively sleepy Inner Sunset, it's just two blocks from the Muni, which will take you to downtown, the Embarcadero, etc. While the suite lacks a kitchen, it does have everything you'll need to make coffee, tea or to heat up leftovers, etc. The building was easy to find and check-in and check-out were fast and painless. I definitely hope to stay here again the next time I'm in SF!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,Absolutely perfect place to stay in SF! I used to live in SF and was traveling back for a friends wedding! Kelly's place was perfect to stay for me and my husband! Super clean and very well located! You have your own privacy and street parking wasn't terrible either!  It is on the 3rd floor so if you have heavy luggage just be ready to carry it up a flight of steps (totally do-able)!  The closet was huge and the balcony puts a nice touch on the suite! Will definitely be re-booking here next time I'm back in Sf! =],San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"Kelly’s suite is probably the best place to stay in San Francisco.

The suite is amaizing and I have no words to describe the bathroom! I had not the opportunity to meet Kelly, however my partner did it. She was very nice and helpful. Ah! One last important thing, we did not see any homeless in the neighbour during our stay! I fully recommend it!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"Kelly's place is probably the nicest Airbnb in San Francisco for 2 people. As soon as you walk in, you'll see how spacious the room is and how tall the ceilings are. Everything is spotless and stylish. You can tell that this property has been renovated with many beautiful and modern touches. The bed is very comfortable and just right on the firmness. In addition, we found 2 wrapped chocolate pieces on our pillows! How sweet...! The porch is a lovely spot to gaze at the side of the hill. Also, the bathroom is probably the nicest part of the place. When you see the shower, it is impeccable and very cool to use. The lighting in the entire place is really nice and romantic. Kelly is very responsive and easy to communicate with. Overall, if you can book this place it is WORTH it!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"We loved this place! It’s pretty big and has a lovely little terrace outside. It has everything you need from lotion to shampoo, coffee, chocolates on the pillows and Netflix. We felt very much at home. Kelly was really easy to chat to and let us check in early and leave our bags late so we didn’t have to carry our bags around. Check in was super simple. We loved the bathroom - the shower is so beautiful. Bed is massive and so comfy too! Set in a great little area - easy to get down to the bay and some really great local food place (we particularly enjoyed Kelly’s sushi tip!) very quiet area. Our favourite Air B and B to date!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"This is a perfect spot for a couple! There’s an adorable patio, wine glasses and a wine opener hehe, as well as a bunch of neat shops and restaurants just a few blocks away. I found it perfect because it wasn’t loud with the noises of the city at night, making it easy to sleep. Yet, they were all still close enough to walk to and enjoy. It’s also a nice neighborhood so I definitely felt safe. Kelly also left us with recommendations which was probably my favorite part because the ones we checked out were awesome!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"Kelly's master suite is a FANTASTIC place to stay in the city.  Close to UCSF, public transportation and a wide variety of restaurants and shops between 7th and 9th Avenue in the Inner Sunset district. 

Check in/out was a breeze and Kelly is highly responsive.  The interior decor is very stylish with high-end fixtures,  large walk-in closet, huge walk-in shower, and separate soaking tub. The unit itself is squeaky clean and there are ample electrical plugs/USB ports, 'creature comforts' (Roku/Netflix satellite service, Keurig coffee maker, flat iron, chocolates on pillows, etc) and the king-sized be is ultra comfy.  I HIGHLY recommend this unit and will definitely be back!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"This was my first time visiting San Francisco and I have zero regrets staying here other than wishing I booked for a longer visit. I can already say I miss Kelly’s place. It’s extremely modern, the bathroom is flawless, and the bed/pillows are wonderful. There are plenty of take-out places in the area in case you spend your day out and about and decide to share a meal in for an evening or breakfast - again perfect (plus there is a balcony  to enjoy tea and coffee outside). It is roughly a 10-15 minute or less Uber ride to anywhere in the city. Really can’t write enough good things about my visit and stay. Looking forward to next time!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Golden Gate Park Master Studio with Private Entrance,"The place is excellent. We didn't have any problems to get to it. There is an keyless entry to the apartment.  It is on the third floor. There is a beautiful terrace, private and confortable. We had all we needed for our weekend. There is a store one block from the apartment where you can buy the basics for your stay. It is near by to the public transportation. 2 blocks away. There are many places around where you can have pretty decent meals and a pub where you can have a drink at night. 
You can go to the Golden State Park walking. Beautiful place to hang around and spend the day.
The place was clean and neat. A really calm and quiet neighborhood 
There is no stove, but you don't really need it.
Everything is as described on the webpage. All the instructions are there and well explained.",San Francisco,0
Upscale Private Ensuite Bed & Bath,"Loved staying here! It was quiet and so close to so many fabulous shops, cafes and restaurants. I was only here 1 night but would definitely return if it was available again. Actually tried to come back on my return to SF but sadly it was already booked. Slept very well in the comfortable bed with divine sheets. Remember if you require a kettle to ask Jeff and he will happily provide one. Two recommendations - for great coffee and breakfast around the cnr visit Jane Cafe which opens early and Delfina Pizzeria for a casual dinner just next door.",San Francisco,0
Upscale Private Ensuite Bed & Bath,"Absolutely perfect. Location was amazing with lots of great restaurants in the area. The space was clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Jeff is the best AirBnB host we’ve ever had. He and Mike sent us a very detailed message before our arrival with great suggestions of things to do, and also spent several minutes upon our arrival ensuring we knew the area, and answering any questions. They also allowed us to drop off our luggage before check-in. Can’t say enough about this rental and the hosts!!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Private Ensuite Bed & Bath,"Jeff and Mike are extremely friendly and helpful hosts. They dragged our bags up the stairs for us after a long day of travel, loaned us a backpack for one of our day trips, and gave us suggestions for meals and transportation.  Easy to communicate with them by text. The suite is large and spacious, with high ceilings and a great overhead fan. Funky artwork throughout, which we appreciated. Bed was very comfy, water pressure was excellent in the shower.  We really enjoyed the neighborhood—nothing sketchy, and plenty of good places to eat. Could Uber anywhere in the city for less than $10 if willing to share a ride (but not during rush hour).  Highly recommend, as long as you are able to negotiate a long flight of stairs.",San Francisco,0
Upscale Private Ensuite Bed & Bath,"Room was really clean and they helped us carried our luggage up the stairs! Really appreciate it after a 16 hours flight and stuck 2 hours in the customs. 

Food around the neighbourhood was fantastic! There’s many cafes to chill out too. You could easily get anything you wanted. We fell in love with this big supermarket across the apartment. 

We basically Uber wherever we go. Apartment is near the city and all the touristy places. It cost us less than 10USD to travel anywhere. 


We will def choose this place again if we visit SF.",San Francisco,0
Upscale Private Ensuite Bed & Bath,"This was an extremely nice place, located in a really fabulous neighbourhood with plenty of parks and restaurants to explore.

Our door had it’s own lock which was a big plus considering you are sharing the home with other guests staying in the other bedrooms. 

The biggest plus was the central location of the home. Easy access to anything around the city.

Upscale Private Ensuite Bed & Bath,"Jeffrey’s home is quite stunning and located so centrally to so much! If you’re not into public transportation, the Uber rides to attractions/sites are all fairly inexpensive from Jeffrey’s home. The house is literally across the street from a market and Starbucks and right next to a parking lot, so we did not have maneuver San Francisco’s crazy parking zones. 
     We came from Napa and arrived three hours before our check-in time, but Jeffrey allowed us to drop off our (ridiculously huge) bags and even brought them upstairs and had them waiting on our room at 3pm! The room was just as pictured; it has huge ceilings, beautiful finishes and the en-suite bathroom is stunning with the best lighting and full-length mirror.
     The bedroom was among four other bedrooms on the second floor occupied by other air-bnb travelers (which I didn’t realize before) but we never heard any of the others and we felt completely comfortable. (Website hidden by Airbnb) highly recommend Jeffrey’s home!",San Francisco,0
Upscale Private Ensuite Bed & Bath,"Jeffrey was an absolutely wonderful host for our little staycation. The home is situated in a perfect location with 100% walkability to my favorite parts of SF, and has so much personality and charm. The entry, while shared, still feels extremely private and the room served us perfectly for our overnight stay. The suite is completely updated with high-end fixtures, gorgeous natural light, and complete privacy. While there is no access to a kitchen, all of the best food is within blocks and within minutes of the front door. I was also pleasantly surprised at the setup of receiving my own key to the front door (I’ve only rented entire homes previously), where three private suites are all accessible from the main hall, and Jeffrey’s private residence is an entirely separate entrance. Jeffrey is extremely accommodating for check-in and check-out and highly communicative with prompt, informative responses. He was very generous in his offer to let us keep our belongings with him for safekeeping while we explored the area for the day, well past our checkout time. I’ll consider this my little Pied-à-terre from now on, and can’t thank the host(s) enough for their kindness and hospitality! It checks all the boxes and then some.",San Francisco,0
Upscale Private Ensuite Bed & Bath,"We highly recommend this AirBnB! We had a great time in San Francisco based on the tips from Jeffrey. The location of the house is very safe, even at night. You can either walk to the famous spots or take the bus, which stops near the house. The supermarket, which is located right on the other side of the street, offers all the stuff you need for your stay. There are several really good restaurants and cafes in the direct neighborhood. The house is really beautiful and the room was very clean and has a stylisch equipment. We liked it a lot. Be aware that parking is extremely expensive everywhere in San Francisco.",San Francisco,0

We enjoyed every minute of our stay here and would book again in a heart beat.

Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"My family came from out of town to visit and we needed a place that accommodated 5 people with plenty of room and finding this place was a gem! Nina and Merv’s place was absolutely fabulous! We arrived earlier than expected and they were very kind to let us come ahead to the place. Upon our arrival we quickly noticed how the safe, quiet, and just beautiful the neighborhood was. The place itself was clean and they made sure we had plenty of towels, pillows, blankets, hangers, etc. There is plenty of closet and drawer space for clothing, luggage, and shoes. We really appreciated the kitchen that came fully equipped with everything we could need to cook dinner along with coffee pot, cereal in the pantry, some food items in the fridge/freezer, and plenty of coffee and extras. :) The pool and hot tub were amazing and very clean. Nina and Merv even provided beach towels and washed a load of towels for us while we were there! They also provided local restaurants to try which came in handy. Overall, this place felt like home and was very cozy. Nina and Merv were very kind, their dogs are cute and friendly, and we feel lucky to have stayed at their place! -Madi & the girls",Virginia Beach,0
Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"Our family of 6 greatly enjoyed our stay at Nina's place. If I could give it 10 stars I would.   It was very comfortable, relaxing and VERY clean!!!  Nina was an excellent host and made us feel very welcome!  The pool and hot tub were incredible and so relaxing and the dogs were very sweet.  Our kids loved when they come over to visit.   Nina was always available but giving us privacy. My husband enjoyed the few conversations he had with Nina's husband.   Sadly, due to the hurricane we felt we needed to leave early so we wouldn't be caught in traffic and Nina was very understanding!  We would highly recommend staying here and definitely wouldn't hesitant to stay here again!",Virginia Beach,0
Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"Nina's house is fantastic. Definitely one of the greatest AirBnBs out there. There is ample space for hanging out, sleeping and cooking and every space is spotlessly clean. The outdoor terrace is perfect for a morning coffee or breakfast and the pool right next to it is the place to be in the afternoons. The view toward the garden in the back of the house is  amazing and the whole ambience is very peaceful. Nina has thoughtfully provided all necessary dinnerware, towels for the pool and also juices, cereal boxes and other things for breakfast and snacking. I could easily say that Nina's house is a destination on its own when visiting VA Beach area and can give the local hotels a run for their money - Nina's house is around ten times better!!! Thank you for the hospitality, Nina!",Virginia Beach,0
Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"Nina's place is in a quiet location and beautiful apartment. The apartment is comfortable and quaint. It was nice waking up in the morning and having a cup coffee on the deck. The kitchen was stocked with coffee, tea, coffee pot and Keurig, filters, sugar, cereal and juice.  Nina leaves detailed instructions on the use of the apartment and amenities, very helpful. There are dogs on the premises and they are adorable. We used the hot tub, which was very relaxing. I would highly recommend staying at Nina's Place, you will not be disappointed.",Virginia Beach,0
Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"Nina and her husband were great hosts. The location is about a half hour from the beach and located in a quaint neighborhood.   I wish we came during a warmer season so we could use the pool and hot tub.   The guest house was neat and homey, decorated very cute. There were some cereals and coffee provided for us as well! Beautiful outdoor seating.  One downside is that it is over a garage, so it can be a little smelly when walking up to the bedroom. It smelled fine in the actual place where we stayed.",Virginia Beach,0
Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"In many ways, I hate to give a review like this because if people read it, they will know that this is THE PLACE to stay if you're coming to Hampton Roads.  It's like having your own 2 bedroom house!  Nina met us as we pulled into their driveway and showed us to the Air B&B unit, which is a 2 bedroom apartment above a three car garage.  Nina had EVERYTHING you would need, including milk in the fridge, cereal in the pantry, apple juice, a variety of Keurig flavors, and much more.  The place is spotless and the deck out back is phenomenal for relaxing among the tall, stately oak trees.  I really can't find a single thing to list here that I didn't like.  Everything you could possibly want on a trip away from home was provided here.  She also had a swimming pool and hot tub available should you want to relax in that fashion.  Overall, a fantastic place to stay.  I will be back and try to stay here anytime I'm in the Chesapeake, Virginia Beach, Norfolk area.  Absolutely wonderful.",Virginia Beach,0
Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"Nina's home was everything we could've wanted for our stay. The home itself was beautiful, spacious, well-lit, and clean. It's in a quiet, wooded neighborhood with plenty of privacy and easy parking. When we arrived, it was just starting to rain so Nina met us in the driveway and offered to help bring our bags upstairs. She was extremely friendly and gave us a tour to make sure we knew where everything was, including many extra pillows, blankets, and towels. She and her husband live on the property and were available in case we needed anything, but the home was so well-stocked we didn't have any problems! The hot tub and pool were especially relaxing, and we loved hanging out with their extremely friendly dogs. If we are ever in the area again, we would definitely love to return!",Virginia Beach,0
Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"If you want a private escape with a private pool and hot tub with a beautiful serene 3 acre setting to view from your second story deck - Nina's is the place to be!  Personal touches galore in the apartment, welcoming hosts that checked in just to be sure there was nothing we needed and an absolutely spotless 2 bedroom apartment.  Everything we wanted to do and see was within a 1/2 hours drive and the local restaurants were great and very close to the property.  What more could you ask for.   This was our first AirBNB experience and I have to say, I think we stumbled on the best of the best.  Our experience at Nina's is going to be hard for any other AirBNB host to beat!   Thanks a million to Nina and Merv for a wonderful experience!  We'll be back for sure.",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"Chris & Tim's place was great for my week and half stay in the Virginia Beach Area. The cottage is surrounded by beautiful trees and plants and there are many parks to explore in the area too. The cottage itself was very nice and had a nice homey feeling to it. They had all the amenities needed and provided nice additional items like chocolate, tea, and an extensive selections of books as well. I met Chris & Tim multiple times during my stay; they were nice to talk to and they gave me multiple pointers on things to in the area that suited my interest. If back in the area again I would love to stay at their cottage again.",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"This was a quick weekend stop after I got engaged. My maid of honor accompanied me. Tim was very attentive to our needs and helped us with our bags. The first night was pretty hot and Tim put a dehumidifier in the cottage. When that was not sufficient, the next morning he put in the AC. We were “cool” from there. The location is walking distance to some great restaurants on the water.  There is construction so you have to careful when walking. There is a local transportation system that will take you to the local bars and back to the cottage. The location is close to First Landing Park and there was a bike shop close by called Switching Gears. We rented a couple of bikes and rode thru the state park and to the boardwalk. Also, there is a quaint coffee shop and a beautiful preserve a few blocks away. We had a great time!",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,It was very obvious that Chris and Tim knew and love the area. They offered so much invaluable advice that made our travels and experiences so smooth and memorable. The house itself was very quaint and cute and stocked with anything you could need. The biggest plus would have to be a basked packed full with lemurs from amazing local dining options. The location of this place worked out great for us. It took no time at all to get to the ocean front and seconda to get to the closest beach and restaurants. Would highly recommend and would gladly go back.,Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"Chris and Tim's place was awesome! It was so relaxing and quiet. A block from the beach, it can't get any better. Huge library of books to choose from with all sorts of genera. Fully stocked kitchen for cooking if you want to. I would love to buy this place it's so stinking cute! Also, they provided all linens so that was really nice that we didn't have to bring that like previous beach airbnbs we've stayed in. We would love to come back! We had a great time! Chris and Tim are phenomenal hosts with plenty of information if and when you want it.",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"Chris and Tim are like the neighbors you would always hope to have— they are incredibly friendly, helpful, and very easy to get along with!  The cottage (aka OPC) is quaint and cozy, and it is the perfect size for any couple looking for a beach getaway!   We ended up bringing a computer to watch Netflix during the times we were rained in or between activities (I.e. there is no tv), and it worked perfectly in our favor.  This was the perfect vacation we were looking to have, and the OPC was the perfect place to stay! ",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"We absolutely loved our stay here. The location was perfect and we could walk to restaurants, trails, and the beach. The cottage was so cozy, clean, and decorated lovely. Our hosts were amazing and friendly and made us feel at home. Any question we had, they answered right away and they were so helpful with all their suggestions for things to do. There is an amazing library of books at hand. And a basket filled with ideas and suggestions for restaurants and places to go, each with hand written notes. I highly recommend staying here. We can’t wait to come back!",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"The first thing you’ll notice is that Chris and Tim want you to have the best time possible. They are quick to offer advice on where to go, what to see, and where to eat. The front garden is magical and the cottage is so nicely decorated and appointed. The location is unbeatable- super close to parks, the beach, restaurants, and plenty of things to do. Two things I wish I had known/paid attention to before we arrived - the bed is so soft that we both ended up on muscle relaxers half way through our trip, and there’s no tv. It would have been nice to have a couch to stretch out on. I totally get it about no tv - there’s enough to do outside that you don’t need indoor entertainment. We just like to have the news on as we wake up and fall asleep.  We had a great time and are totally giving 5 stars. Those two things couldn’t overshadow the magic of the cottage or how wonderful our hosts were!",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"My husband and I had a fabulous stay! It was our first time in Virginia Beach and we couldn’t have picked a better place. The location was perfect and the hosts were amazing.   The cottage felt very private and yet we were close to a variety of things to do! We were only a 5 minute walk away from the beach and just a hop away from a variety of great places to eat and drink. Chris & Tim made great recommendations for us and we are so appreciative of the attentiveness. They think of every little detail! Next time we’re in the area, we would love to stay here again!  thank you!",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"Chris and Tim were wonderful!! From the very start, they answered our questions quickly and were willing to help us with each step of the planning process. The cottage was very clean, with all the amenities you would need for an enjoyable stay. It is close to Shore Drive, but yet seems very private, thanks to a beautiful garden area. There is even an outdoor shower and all sorts of beach items for guests to use. If we needed anything extra during our stay, we could just ask. They are so knowledgeable about the area and have countless tips for restaurants, activities and even gave us a heads up on the weather! We would absolutely stay again the next time we are in town. Don’t miss booking this gem.",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"The cottage was cozy and peaceful, in a quiet neighborhood right by the beach. It was within walking distance of a bunch of restaurants, as well. The space was serene, the bed was comfy, and if we had wanted to cook, there was a fully-equipped kitchen available. Tim and Chris were great hosts and had lots of great recommendations! They also had some beach gear available, if we wanted to borrow anything. We had a great, relaxing weekend and would love to come back again to finish exploring the rest of the area we didn't get a chance to see! Thanks again!",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Retreat,"Melissa is a super host, and definitely one of the most kind and thoughtful people I've met through Airbnb. Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach. However, what makes our experience way too memorable and extraordinary is the personal touch that Melissa adds in terms of extra amenities, tips, recommendations etc. In our case, she was very kind and thoughtful to let us know about her bikes, beach chairs etc. and borrow them. She also had good suggestions on local places to go, restaurants and pubs etc. I'd 100% recommend spending your time at Virginia Beach / Norfolk at Melissa's. ",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Retreat,"Melissa's home is an amazing place to stay. The room was clean and was perfect for my best friend and I's beach trip. The house is easily accessible, the neighborhood was quiet, and close to the beach. This place is worth the money! Melissa was also very considerate and kept in good communication with us during our stay. The planes overhead were especially loud when we stayed (which didn't bother us because we were so exhausted from the beach), but Melissa was kind enough to ask if we had slept okay. If I can, I would DEFINITELY book this room again.",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Retreat,"I think you never regret if you will chose Melisa's house. The bed is my ideal (7 pillows ) and bathroom is very pretty, Melisa really ready for everything, if you forgot towels, shampoo, soap, sunscreen, she can give all it for you; location little far to beach, but you can take bike and less than 10 minutes you will be on the beach; never try to buy something in beach cafe, it's too expensive. There is Food Lion not so far from house and you can drink coffee every morning. So I am sure you will love this place. P.S. She has a guitar and ukulele",Virginia Beach,0
Ocean Retreat,"Melissa's place is not fancy, but it was within cycling distance of the beach and restaurants, and she was friendly and helpful with dining suggestions. I was only there for a short one night stay, but I brought my bicycle and had a great ride through a nearby park that came out close to Rudees Inlet, where I picked up the boardwalk and rode to the north end of the beach for a swim and a great meal at a local restaurant. I saw Melissa at checkin but got up early and left. The house was quiet. The room is simple, and well decorated, and the bed was comfortable.",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"A great getaway spot! My husband and I took a few days together away from the kids to enjoy the beach & this place was perfect - cute, clean, and walking distance from the beach and almost every restaurant & activity we enjoyed during our trip. Star & Austin were great hosts and checked in with us several times throughout the visit to make sure we had everything we needed. We especially liked that they had a chalkboard with their restaurant recommendations in the room & we checked several of them out!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"This airbnb was one of the best I've stayed in so far. Great value, exceptionally clean, comfortable and cozy, with everything we needed for a short getaway. The place was exactly as described and shown. Star and Austin were always quick to respond to any questions we had and went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed during our stay. The airbnb is in a quiet neighborhood, but still close to the beach and all the downtown amenities. They recommended great restaurants and provided what we needed for our days at the beach. I would definitely stay at this airbnb again when visiting Virginia Beach. ",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"My wife and I stayed here for an extended weekend anniversary getaway, and it was perfect. Star and Austin provided so many nice touches, including bikes, a hammock, beach towels, premium TV (Netflix, Prime) - even aloe vera gel in the fridge for the inevitable. House is a five minute walk to beach but also situated in a quiet cul de sac, aside a pond.   Coffee and filter water provided, but there's no kitchen, so plan to eat out or buy prepared foods. Lots of options are nearby, which you'll enjoy biking to.  Strongly recommend. ",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"Star and Austin's home was clean and comfortable - I felt at home as soon as we walked in the door! They had shampoo, conditioner, soaps, towels, even bikes and beach chairs! We rode the bikes to the beach each day (about a 4 minute ride away). There are quite few restaurants within biking/ walking distance as well that were recommended by Star and Austin.  We saw them once or twice as we were coming and going from the home.  They were extremely hospitable and I greatly appreciated that they checked on us via message after the first night to see if we needed anything (which we didn't! We loved it!) Thank you for an easy, comfortable stay! I highly recommend and would stay here again!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"This is the second year that my boyfriend and I have stayed at Star and Austin's place and I could not recommend it more.  It's secluded but within walking distance of local breweries, coffee shops, great restaurants and the beach (which has everything you could want/need).  With a dedicated parking space and a private entrance, you feel as if you are staying in your own apartment -- and in a sense, you are.  The bed is comfortable and the linens are clean and soft (and there are extra in the linen closet which is always nice!).  The TV/sitting area is a nice place to unwind after a night out or a day on the beach.  The small touches and local recommendations are super thoughtful as well.  I would 100% recommending staying with Star and Austin if you're ever in the VB area!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"Star and Austin's place is perfect for a getaway to the beach! The location, just about 2 blocks from the ocean, makes it super easy to get to the boardwalk and the sand. The bikes they provide are also a great amenity! We used them not only to get to the beach, but to get all around town. The room itself is very clean and comfortable and provides all the things you'd need to get out to the beach for the day or to enjoy a relaxing morning or evening on the couch. We also appreciated the provided coffee and to-go cups and the fridge/freezer combo. Lots of thoughtful touches. Great value for a place so close to everything!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"It was our first time in Virginia Beach, and it has won over our hearts... and our stay at Star and Austin’s place played a huge role in that experience. The location was a few blocks away from the beach and the neighborhood was close by a few of our favorite coffee and dining spots. Their place was super cozy and had such amazing amenities. Our favorite thing to do was to take the bikes out to roam about the city, stopping by cute local stores and listening to late night music jams. My husband and I are already planning our trip out to Virginia Beach next year and we hope to stay here again!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"Austin and Star were accommodating from the beginning. We were driving from Lehigh Valley, PA., and knew we would get in a lot sooner than the 3 PM check-in. Star allowed us to check in earlier upon our arrival. Inside, you will find a coffee machine, and signs to great local spots to eat. My girlfriend and I walked to the beach every day, but one day, when Star was in the backyard, she offered a ride which was not asked for but definitely appreciated. I would definitely come back to their residence again, and you will not be disappointed!  On a side note, check out The shack, Calypso, Captain George’s, get a 3 day bus pass for the goHRT bus to take you down Pacific and Atlantic, and definitely check out the Cape Henry lighthouse.",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"My girlfriend and my experience at Star and Austin’s place was better than expected.  Star and Austin were responsive and were accurate in their description. They provided all the information we would need upon booking/leading up to our check in like how to self check in which was good. The place had a “beachy” feel with a surfboard inside and decorations which we liked.  The location was very close to the beach. We decided to take our car to the beach when we went, but we didn’t necessarily have to.  We had a parking spot in the driveway for the duration of our stay which was awesome. Star and Austin did offer us bikes to use which was sweet, but we didn’t end up using them.  The temperature of the apartment was very cold which was refreshing after sweating all day at the beach. Star and Austin provided local restaurant suggestions which we took advantage of and liked!  We would definitely stay here again if brought back to the area!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"This place surpassed our expectations. We packed a bunch of toiletries that they already provided which was so kind! They provided: body wash, shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, an iron, and a first aid kit. The kitchen also included a full size fridge, paper plates, cutlery, and plastic cups- this was great because we didn’t think to purchase these and ordered in one night. The tv also has an amazon fire stick and the WiFi was strong. The place was also spotless! I usually do a wipe down of any hotel we book and I didn’t need to here. There were no spaces ignored. It’s obvious these owners really care about the space and your stay- they checked in with us on a few occasions. We are hoping to visit again soon and try out another one of their locations! Thank you Star & Austin, this air b n b was one of the highlights of our trip.",Virginia Beach,0
Private Secluded Studio a Stone's Throw from the Beach,"Christine’s place was awesome! My wife and I came here for a long weekend and really enjoyed ourselves. The place was very clean and the TV was huge (75 in. I think) .. Christine had chairs, umbrellas, beach towels and blankets we were able to bring to the beach with us. We asked if she had a cooler and she let us borrow one for the weekend which was a major bonus. Her daughter in law Maddie was extremely helpful as well. We appreciated everything about our stay. If we make our way back down to Virginia Beach, Christine’s place will be the first place we look up. Thank you again! ",Virginia Beach,0
Private Secluded Studio a Stone's Throw from the Beach,"This air bnb was great. The space was super cute and also had everything you needed for an extended stay. It was located a couple blocks from the boardwalk, which was totally walkable and very conveniently located to grocery stores, shops and places to dine by bike ride, short Uber ride or walking. Extremely clean and the host was very quick to respond/help with anything. The bikes they supplied were our favorite. Saved us money on Uber rides and were also just fun. Loved this place and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Secluded Studio a Stone's Throw from the Beach,"Christine's place is a stylish and modern space, tastefully decorated and perfect for a quiet couples getaway.  It is attached to her home but feels very secluded with separate, outside access around the side.  Keeping this in mind we were respectful of the host and they of use - I did not hear or see anyone the whole time, making for a private stay.  The place is clean and well equipped - including coffee and creamer, which is very nice!  My wife and I brought our own bikes, even though there were beach cruisers provided and it is very easy to bike from the house to the boardwalk bike path and back.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to getaway for a long weekend and will keep it in mind for our future trips!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Secluded Studio a Stone's Throw from the Beach,"Great location,  close to beach, parks and restaurants, but also private and cozy. The inside space was lovely and very comfortable. Bath is smallish and up a couple stairs, but nice. The kitchenette was just right and had everything one could need to make light meals. The outside was also very nice with pretty landscaping and a view of  a small wetlands area and golf course. Really appreciated the private patio area too.  Bikes were a little tricky to ride when you’re not used to “chopper”style handlebars and are accustomed to handbrakes. But definitely a very nice space. Good off street parking. Communication with owner was prompt and easy  check-in.",Virginia Beach,0
Private Secluded Studio a Stone's Throw from the Beach,"Christine was an extremely welcoming and gracious hostess and gave my partner and I a good feel for the city of Virginia Beach as first time visitors.  The guest house was exactly as described and pictured, and had pretty much everything we needed and more.  We had more than enough space and the entire lot is very private with a beautiful backyard if you want to take a few moments to observe nature.  Wish we had stayed longer, but if/when we return to the beachfront we'll definitely be keeping Christine's place in mind!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Secluded Studio a Stone's Throw from the Beach,Christine’s place was perfect for a stay that my girlfriend and I made for a long weekend. The house was perfectly clean and well decorated and easily accessible to the beach. We both felt super comfortable and Christine responded immediately to our questions when we checked in. The cherry on top were the 2 bikes included next to the house which we used the entire weekend. Not sure what renting bikes elsewhere would have costed but the ease of use with these and being able to ride them everywhere back and forth made the trip that much better. I recommend Christine’s place for anyone visiting Virginia beach!,Virginia Beach,0
Private Secluded Studio a Stone's Throw from the Beach,"This place is so great. The space itself is very nice and comfortable and is in the center of everything. Tons of activities and restaurants nearby, and just a few blocks away from the beach.   Christine provides special touches that really made the experience for us. From cruiser bikes to ride around town to beach blankets and towels, everything we needed was already there!   Christine also provides some great suggestions of places to eat and things to do if you are at a loss during your stay.   I completely recommend staying here!",Virginia Beach,0
Private Secluded Studio a Stone's Throw from the Beach,"The place was fabulous! Some things you should know....  1) it only takes 4 1/2 minutes to walk to the beach!   2) the place is bigger than it seems in the picture (and really nicely kept)  3) her recommendations were spot on.   4) has a fully stocked kitchenette. (Coffee, supplies, microwave, hairdryer, detergent)  5) a HUGE high def TV! I mean 75 inch + with surround sound. Crazy nice  6) high quality beach umbrella, towels, chairs, and bikes. It was enough for two but it seems she would give more if you needed.",Virginia Beach,0
Quiet neighborhood 7 miles from the Beaches,"Mona is a wonderful host!  You have a separate private entrance, full bathroom, room, living room, and a covered outdoor area. If you choose, you can rent out another bedroom too. There is a door that separates your place and Mona’s half of the home.   In the living room area, there is a mini fridge (not freezer) and microwave in addition to a coffee machine. There are plates, cups, and plastic ware, which is a nice touch.   I throughly enjoyed the shower! There are two shower heads, so it’s very spa like!!  The room, bathroom, and space is very clean! I usually wear shower shoes or re-clean places, but at Mona’s place, there isn’t a need! It really is spotless.  Thanks for a cozy stay! I would stay here again for sure.  - Chloe",Virginia Beach,0
Quiet neighborhood 7 miles from the Beaches,"Great location, great value, comfortable beds, big bedrooms. I wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. Mona responded nearly immediately to any messages, and was extremely accommodating for letting us bring our two dogs. The bathroom was beautifully renovated, and it was very nice to have a mini fridge. I didn't think about it in advance, but since there's no kitchen, no water other than from the sink, so I would bring a Brita pitcher or water bottles next time. Mona had a list of restaurants and things to do in the area that was a very nice touch. The neighborhood seemed very safe. I would definitely stay with Mona again the next time I'm in Virginia Beach!",Virginia Beach,0
Quiet neighborhood 7 miles from the Beaches,"Truly a beautiful quite neighborhood not far from the beach at all! The space provided was beyond comfortable, and Mona's communication was excellent! The neighborhood was super friendly and a sight to behold with a small near by lake. Definitely great for a morning stroll before heading to the beach. Additionally the neighborhood is also extremely close to an assortment of restaurants and other entertainment outside of just the beach.  I would highly recommend Mona's space for anyone looking for a place to stay in VA beach!",Virginia Beach,0
Quiet neighborhood 7 miles from the Beaches,"We wanted to move in.  We are so thankful we chose this spot! Immaculately clean. The screen in porch is nothing short of magical. The nature in the backyard is, too. Cute little touches of culture and art are sprinkled throughout the rooms without making the space feel too “lived in.”  That bathtub and shower will make your trip so worth it.   AND THE BED! So comfy!! We got a wonderful nights sleep.   Mona was so quick to respond and wonderful to talk to. Her restaurant/amenity suggestion list was really helpful.  The neighborhood is so quiet and safe. Do yourself a favor and book to stay here as long as you can! It’s truly relaxing.   ",Virginia Beach,0
Quiet neighborhood 7 miles from the Beaches,"My dog Benson and I had a great stay at Mona's place! We were in town for a quick 36 hours for a wedding, and Mona was very accommodating with helping us check in a bit early. She even offered to let my dog out while I was at the wedding, and lent me a phone charger when I realized I forgot my own. The space itself was perfect - super comfy bed, huge TV, brand new bathroom with an amazing shower! All very clean and well kept. Our favorite part was the fenced backyard for my pup and the screened in porch. Perfect for relaxing with coffee in the morning (there's a microwave, mini fridge and coffee station with coffee and tea). When I am in town for travels next, I will be sure to stay again!",Virginia Beach,0
Quiet neighborhood 7 miles from the Beaches,"Mona's place was lovely! The screened in porch with hammock where you can look out over a little tributary is so peaceful! The shower is fantastic and the bed was super comfortable. I recommend traveling with a sleep mask if early light can wake you up as the sun does poor into the bedroom behind the shade. We went to the beach the night we arrived, which was just a short little drive, no more than 15 minutes with traffic.  There is a microwave, standard coffeemaker and mini fridge in the space if you them but there were also several dining options nearby. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Mona's place again!",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"Brent & Barry have the whole Air Bnb game down to a science! My husband and I stayed there for 3 nights and wanted for nothing. We were greeted upon arrival, even with our late check in. We were walked up to our secluded getaway, where we were told to ask for anything. There was a bottle of wine, beer, and snacks waiting for us. We took full advantage of that Had a wonderful nights sleep, and woke up to an email asking if everything went ok our first night...which it did. The place is decorated super cute and trendy. It felt like we were staying in a Pinterest/Instagram dream. We recommend this place to anyone that wants a secluded getaway, and to be right at the beach. Can't say enough about this super clean, hip apartment. Wish we could have stayed longer!!",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"This was our first Airbnb stay and our first time to Norfolk!  We had such a fantastic time.  The Carriage House sits on a beautiful, clean beach in a residential area.  Each time we walked to the beach we only saw a few other folks either jogging or walking their dogs.  It's very peaceful.  There are some great restaurants and a grocery store nearby- we loved the area.  We also thought the locals were extremely friendly.  Brent and Barry's Carriage House is clean, comfortable, and has every little thing you could possibly need.  It actually felt like staying at a friend's house (right down to the stocked keurig and cold beer in the fridge!).  You can tell they love their home and we felt lucky to be able to stay there.  It's very special.  There is also a cute little garden where you can relax with a glass of wine (and still get wifi if you need it).  My husband and I traveled with our two small kids (6 and 2) but I also think this would be a perfect spot for a single traveler or a couple looking for a quick getaway.  I hope to be back!",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"Brent's place was in a great location, the home furnishings were comfortable and very well themed for a beach house, and the space was well utilized for it's size. It's a perfect amount of space for 2-3 people, and the Keurig coffee maker and the huge variety of coffee flavors was an extra touch that we greatly appreciated after long flights from the West Coast.  My favorite part about his home was definitely location. It's a 1-2 minute walk to the beach, and I had an awesome time running alongside the shore early in the morning.   Brent was also super accommodating, very responsive, and would check in here and there to make sure we had a pleasant and comfortable stay at his home. Thanks again, Brent!",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"Everything was PERFECT!  The Carriage House was Very Clean, nicely decorated, beds were comfortable, the kitchen was stocked with every cooking appliance that we needed for our stay, lots of great coffee flavors, snacks, and even a bottle of wine, the new deck was beautiful too !   I will never stay at a hotel for vacation again, this experience spoiled me & my family.  Brent and Barry introduced themselves to us on our 2nd day due to our late check-in, they were both so very friendly, they made us feel right at home.  They both were super quick to reply to any questions or requests that we made,  our whole experience was AWESOME!  We sure hope to come back next year and stay again!",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"My family had an amazing beach week at The Carriage House! Convenient location, just steps from the sand! Brent was a caring host, attentive and super responsive to anything we needed. The house had a pretty, coastal vibe throughout -- we enjoyed all of the decor. Bedrooms were clean, and all was comfortable. Kitchen area was great, stocked with all of the appliances, cookware & dishes we needed. We appreciated all of the extra touches -- the coffee bar, snacks, the bottle of wine! A lot of pride and thoughtfulness goes into making this stay what it is! Would absolutely love to return and would recommend to anyone seeking that perfect, private little beach getaway!",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"The Carriage House is the PERFECT spot for a beach getaway!  The space was immaculate and stylish, and the keypad check-in was a breeze - Brent even accommodated an early check-in for me since I was already in town on business.  Everything you could hope for and more was provided- soft towels and linens, a stocked Keurig/coffee pods, snacks and wine, games, and a beach bag.  The beach is just steps away and we enjoyed having it almost all to ourselves!!!  Easy short drive to grocery shopping, restaurants and down to the VA Beach boardwalk area.  Sadly we did not cross paths with Brent or Barry but their personal touches, including a thank you note and a list of instructions/restaurant suggestions, made it feel like they were already friends of ours!  My husband, son and I felt so comfortable in the space and it was just like a home away from home.  We will definitely recommend the space and return again in the future!",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"This place is perfect for a family vacation. The house is on the beach and that makes everything so easy when you have a 2 years old with you. Brent's place was spotless, very cozy and made us feel like home. I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's place for our vacation. Also I have to say that the communication with him was above expectations since we went there a week after the hurricane Florence and I was so worried about the weather and the beach, but Brent was honest and so helpful answering to all my questions. He gave us some tips where to eat and do some groceries and that helped also. We can't wait to come back next year!",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"Brent's cottage was absolutely perfect! He has toiletries available for use if you forgot yours at home, I mean stuff you wouldn't think would be available. The cottage is walking distance to the beach. Only downside is the cottage is above the garage but I'm an early riser so it didn't bother me at all.  It has 2 very comfortable queen sized beds, beautiful shower, comfy couch with 2 additional chairs, board games, playing cards, and wine glasses already chilling in the freezer upon your arrival. There is a full kitchen and it is stocked with pots and pans, dishes, silverware, condiments, coffee pot, coffee and tea. This has definitely become my home away from home. The cottage was small but we fit 4 adults perfectly fine.",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"This place is adorable. Cozy 2 bedroom upstairs cottage... with kitchen and living room.  The beach is a few steps away.  It has everything you may need inside the house, and it’s a great location. (about 8 min drive to airport, and very close to many restaurants) We loved our time in Brent’s cottage. One thing to consider- there is 1 bathroom and it is centrally located. The door slides open/ closed. It does not lock. I sometimes felt like I wished I could lock the bathroom door for privacy- but it wasn’t that big of a deal.  I would totally go back! Great place.",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"My family and I had a wonderful experience at The Carriage house.  Brent was very helpful with responding to our questions in a timely manner.  We enjoyed  the close proximity to the beach.  The home was very clean and was supplied with many items just in case you forgot something. They even provided games which were much appreciated on a rainy day. A nice accommodation was the outdoor shower when coming from the beach. Having the peaceful outdoor area also added to a great experience! Overall, I highly recommend staying at the Carriage House especially if you are looking for a quiet and easy access to a beach getaway!",Virginia Beach,0
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"If you are looking for a quiet, private-feel  beach area, this is a cozy place to stay at.  The kids playground across the street and dinning/shopping area within a couple minute drive.  The front yard lounge area with beautiful trees and plants is a nice place to have your ice-cream or just to chill in a shade during hot hours of the day.   We enjoyed the easy check in/check out and the way the place is set up.   Brent is very responsive and available to provide any help and answer any questions.",Virginia Beach,0
"Walk Two Blocks To Beach, Private Entrance to Room","Everything about our stay was wonderful. The place was very clean and had everything we needed!Katherine has put time and effort into the thoughtful details of the offerings of her Airbnb. To top it off, her communication was perfect. She messaged a couple days prior to update us on our early check in request, checked in with us after we arrived to make sure we were able to settle in and to see if we needed anything. If my travels bring me back to the area, I will most certainly look to rebook here!",Virginia Beach,0
"Walk Two Blocks To Beach, Private Entrance to Room","Katherine's thoughtfully furnished room felt more like a self sufficient home. We had everything we needed and then some. She had a huge variety of teas and coffee to choose from. The house was in a quiet yet easily accessible street, only two blocks from an almost private beach. The main boardwalk area is less than 10 minutes away. We're also happy to have spent a beautiful afternoon on their beautiful porch. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and we only wish we could have stayed a few more days. We highly recommend Katherine's home for her thoughtfulness and responsiveness.",Virginia Beach,0
"Walk Two Blocks To Beach, Private Entrance to Room","I was determined to have a swim in the ocean before Hurricane Florence. Fortunately my two day weather window coincided with availability at Katherine’s. She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. I was able to spend a full day at the beach. The conditions were perfectwith  big waves, 85° water and  friendly people on the beach. For supper I went next-door for a takeaway tuna dinner which I enjoyed on my private patio. I continued my beach reading in the most comfortable lounge chair ever.  Katherine’s house is in an old establish beach neighborhood with restaurants, drug store and  grocery store two blocks away.  I can’t wait to book here again.",Virginia Beach,0
"Walk Two Blocks To Beach, Private Entrance to Room","Katherine's place was really clean and really comfortable. It's a good size for one person or a couple. The light was really nice as well. We really enjoyed the kitchenette, which was stocked with plastic silverware, coffee, tea, sugar, and had a coffee maker and electric kettle. Katherine also provided beach towels. I appreciated the special care Katherine took to ensure our comfortable stay. The walk to the beach is short and lets out in kind of a private area since the access is through a regular neighborhood. I had a great stay and would definitely come again",Virginia Beach,0
"Walk Two Blocks To Beach, Private Entrance to Room","Katherine's place is ideal for folks wanting a quiet, peaceful place that is close to the beach.  It's definitely walkable (2 long blocks), but having a car was great and allowed me to check out the beautiful trails of First Landing State Park.   The public beach entrance feels very private and many times I had the beach to myself.   The house is in an old neighborhood with lots of artsy homes and it felt very safe.  Katherine was super responsive and helped out with a few things I had forgotten.  And the bathtub!!!  Super great soaks at night.  The bed is like sinking into a pillow...I slept 9 hours each night!  Thanks so much Katherine:)",Virginia Beach,0
"Walk Two Blocks To Beach, Private Entrance to Room","Staying here was such a treat! The keypad made check-in & out so easy and it was such a nice place. Beautiful decor, a nice bed, and plenty of other little touches made the cottage such an enjoyable place to stay. We loved starting the day hanging out on the cute little porch swing, listening to the birds. The beach is just a short walk away through a beautiful quiet neighborhood. That area really is the perfect place for a little retreat - so peaceful! Be sure to come here if you want to experience the quieter (better) side of Virginia Beach!",Virginia Beach,0
"Walk Two Blocks To Beach, Private Entrance to Room","Katherine is a great host and her place is incredibly cozy and very relaxing.  The mattress is very comfy, very firm (slept well even though I usually prefer a softer mattress) as is the rest of the room.  Just really homey.  The A/C works great, but the weather was nice enough (and the neighborhood safe enough) that most nights I slept with the door open (there's a screen door to keep the bugs out) and the ceiling fan on.  Easy check in/out.  Even a bidet toilet seat in the bathroom that I wasn't quite adventurous enough to try ha ha.  A+ overall.  Would gladly stay again!",Virginia Beach,0
"Walk Two Blocks To Beach, Private Entrance to Room","Me and my boyfriend decided to visit Virginia Beach for few days in the peak season and Katherine’s place looked the best on this website according the price and the accessibility to the beach!   When we arrived, it turned out to be so much better than we expected because we could just walk to the beach and to the local restaurants without using our car.  Her place was supper clean, organized, and located in a very nice neighborhood.  You don’t need to take anything if you choose to book it because there was everything you might need for few days.   If I’ll have the chance to go again to Virginia Beach, I’ll chose Katherine’s place!   Best,  Adelina",Virginia Beach,0
Waterfront Oasis,"5 Star Review for 5 Star Hosts  My husband is having a series of surgeries near by and having Kara and Nick’s place to come back to was a retreat at the end of some stressful days. The property is as described and then some, though it rained I was not able to sit outside on the lovely deck, I did get to see some wildlife, a hawk and an eagle. The sunrises and sunsets are colorful bookends to anyone’s day. Their communication is excellent and we even lost power for an hour or two and they were quick to let me know of its return. They have considered everything and even left a bottle of wine. The bed is comfy, the bathroom spacious with little amenities in case one forgets the essentials. I can see why their place is booked solid. If you see an opening do not hesitate. ",Virginia Beach,0
Waterfront Oasis,"A room with a view. This is my second stay and it is as perfect as the first. My husband’s health took a turn and Kara and Nick took the tome to listen to the ramblings of this middle aged lady after a very long day. They even offered their laundry facilities! They both are polite, compassionate, and real people. Their place is truly a respite. Especially suited for contemplation, writing, or long conversations with a loved one over beverage of choice while watching the sunset gently over the water. It is great to have a full kitchen and they leave nice notes and treats for the guests. ",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,(Website hidden by Airbnb) - Wonderful; Incredible; Spectacular Sunsets;  Eclectic; Astonishing; Comfortable; Relaxing; Exceptional!!!  These are just a few words which describe Chuck's home and setting.   My daughter and I stayed at Wiseacre over Easter weekend and enjoyed every second of our stay.  Chuck and Charlotte are most hospitable!  The bedrooms with bath in-between was ideal.  Sunset over Lake Whitehurst was simply breathtaking.  I certainly was not surprised to just learn that Chuck's home was featured in Reader's Digest as a top airbnb in the state Virginia.   An absolute gem of a place!,Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Chuck and his dog Charlotte are so welcoming!!  My children and I came for my son’s/their brother’s wedding.  There were seven of us in total who stayed there for six nights.  No crabbiness here!   Lots of beautiful space to entertain us.  Both inside and out.     Amazing sunrises and sunsets viewed from this property.   We were here on a very hot week! Couldn’t tell that from inside the house, central air kept us nice and cool.  Outside was brutal!  My two youngest and I had the benches in the great room for our beds.  We found them very comfortable.  The kitchen is to die for.  Every amenity imaginable.  This is the perfect house for entertaining as we found out when we hosted a bbq the day after my son’s wedding.   The large amount of people were split between inside the house and outside near the bbq food truck we had.  So much space to move around. No one was cramped.  Played a lot of different games as well that we set up and borrowed from Chuck.    It is amazing everything you might have forgotten to bring he has and shares with you.  A true godsend when you are many miles from home!  Would love to come again when we can really enjoy all the house has to offer and relax and not march to a wedding’s timetable!",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Let me start by saying this home is absolutely amazing, but what makes this place special is the first class hospitality from Chuck the owner and Bob the maintenance man! We had our wedding here, and it was more than we could have imagined! Hurricane Matthew had left branches and debris all over the yard and when I showed up to check in (early) Bob was already taking care of it to make sure the yard was perfect for our wedding! If you are thinking about a place to have an event, or even a place to get away you’ve found it! Chuck made us feel like we were at our home away from home!! We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you again for everything (Website hidden by Airbnb) ❤ (Website hidden by Airbnb) Staci & Devin",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Everything about the location of this home was fantastic, both the water-front lot the home is on, and the proximity to the best that Norfolk has to offer.  The wide, 2 story picture window view of Lake Whitehurst is alive with nature and tranquil with its beauty. His home is a real treat to discover with the unique architecture. Chuck is a consummate host, who sincerely cares about his guests. We felt very warmly welcomed. The house has so many great features that you just have to visit to find out what its all about. We chose his place because it was so close to the Norfolk Botanical Garden, which I highly recommend. If you get a chance to visit Norfolk, his home provides everything you need for a relaxing visit.",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Folks - This place and experience is AMAZING.  When we first thought of booking I was hesitant due to the owner being on-site, after discussing with my wife and family we decided to give it a try.  First - the home is amazing, the views, the water, the grounds everything is immaculate and breathtaking. Chuck is present when you ask/need him or invisible if you just seek silence however I must add, Chuck and his wonderful four legged friend Charlotte are sooooo much fun.  Chuck is a wealth of information, knowledge, traveled experiences, amazing people he was worked with/for, you will not regret staying here, I promise you.  I'm a veteran Airbnb'er and my reviews are always honest to help that next future guest.  For what it is worth, we will be back as we have formed a new friend at Wiseacre.  Oh by the way, 5 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from literally everything (food, shopping, historic sites, gardens, etc...); I now understand why this property is voted by Airbnb a top USA Property - it really is AMAZING!",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"At Wiseacre, you can expect a superb host, warm and relaxing surroundings that will make you smile, and a stay that you will remember in your heart.  Every amenity listed is indeed there, but words in descriptions don't really do the place justice.  You have to see for yourself.  Chuck immediately makes you feel at home, listens, and does everything he can to help you get what you're looking for in an Air B and B experience.  His suggestions for things to do when we were out exploring were all spot on and nothing you'd find in any guide book or brochure.  We hope to return soon!",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"There are just no words to describe this place. After me and my boyfriend lost our dear grandmothers within four days apart, we needed a retreat. From the very second I pulled in the driveway I felt at home. Chuck was the most gracious, funny, warming, magical host. My boyfriend and I laughed, cried(happy tears), relaxed, and stood still. In our 4.679 years of dating this was the best place for us to retreat, recover, and nourish our souls. I will be back over and over and over again. Don’t hesitate. Book. It. Right. Now. Until next time Charismatic Chuck and Charming Charlotte.  I can’t tell you enough how thankful we are.",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Great place! My friends and I booked Chuck's place for a fun weekend at VA beach. We didn't know that there was a music festival going on at the same time but Chuck let us know and recommended some great beaches at the Chesapeake Bay that were not crowded at all. We also cooked all of our meals and Chuck would run the dishwasher and put away the dishes while we were away which was so convenient and thoughtful. He even had put out a personalized sign welcoming our group. Overall, Chuck was a very thoughtful host and I would recommend his place!",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"We stayed at Wiseacre for an extended holiday weekend and family wedding in Norfolk. The house is exactly as pictured - sprawling, unique, and welcoming. We found the beds to be very comfortable, the bathroom and kitchen to be modern and well-appointed, and the space very accommodating for relaxing and refreshing both inside and out. Chuck is an excellent host - communication was always prompt and clear and we felt very welcome to share his home immediately. We have highly recommended and shared this opportunity with friends and family. Enjoy!",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"If you want a quiet beach vacation or long weekend, this is an excellent choice.  You really have run of the house and Chuck really thinks of everything.  There is an abundance of everything you could need for your stay.  Chuck even provided an abundant bowl of candy in each room, I found this inspired.  The home is convenient to the VB and Norfolk area to get to the beach, restaurants and local attractions.  I would go back without a moment of hesitation.  I truly enjoyed my stay at the Wiseacre Estate.",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Needed a quick stay in Virginia beach as it was a last minute trip, found Chucks house and immediately booked it. Afterwards we discovered that he lives on the property, i’ve stayed in many air bnbs but never one with a live in host, so we were a bit curious / anxious as to how it would go, however it was amazing! Chuck was so awesome and welcoming, and the house is so quirky and fun. Even though he had little to no notice we were booking that night he accommodated us and everything was more than perfect! Such a cool host and a experience me and my friends will cherish and remember forever!",Virginia Beach,0
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"The stay here was amazing! it exceeded our expectations, there's nothing bad to say about this place. Chuck was really good at answering our questions and giving us advice of places near by. Chuck being in the house was the only concern, but it didn't even feel like he was in the house with us. The location is also perfect, 2 minutes away from stores like Food Lion, 3-5 minutes away from East Beach, 15-20 mins away from the center of VA Beach, and if you really want to go in the lake, the first bit of the lake is shallow and will only reach your knees. There are plenty of restaurants to go eat at if you want to eat out. Over all, I would recommend this place to anyone, you won't regret it. Our group had 12 people and there was still space for more. :)",Virginia Beach,0
"Charming cute cabin, superhost","This little home is cozy, comfortable and very well supplied. We generally had breakfast and dinner there and had everything available to cook our meals that we have at home - even a french press for coffee!  Lots of notes on things that are humorous and helpful.  It was great to have a washer and dryer that worked well, a roomy kitchen and living area.  Bedrooms were small but the beds were really comfortable for us.  Ceiling fans helped cool things down in the evening and helped to make a good nights sleep.   The neighborhood is transitional as described but the 5 days we were there we did not have any disturbance from the neighbors and nothing in the neighborhood caused us a problem or gave us concern.  Great location to get to downtown Seattle or Tacoma and not a bad drive to Rainier or Olympic National Parks.  We hope to see Geneva and Brian again!!",Tacoma,0
"Charming cute cabin, superhost",I’ve been lucky with nearly always great places where I’ve stayed with AirBnB. But once in a while something is just that much better than the rest for yourself and it leaves a footprint in your travel memory. This is one of those places. Historic. Modern amenities. Charming. Thoughtful. Convenient. A value. Family friendly and business travel friendly. The kind of place you hope doesn’t get noticed by others. But obviously it has. And it should for hosts that deserve to be successful for their efforts. For good reason. I’ll be back.,Tacoma,0
"Charming cute cabin, superhost","The cabin has ample space for my family of three. It has a lot of toys and books to keep my little one entertained. The kitchen is well stocked. The bed in the main bedroom is comfy. We had very good night sleep. The bathroom is the only space that feels small but it’s not a big deal. The location is a short drive from several museums although it’s far away from stores and restaurants. There was construction near the highway during our stay so mapping with cellphones was not reliable when going around detour. All in all, we had a great time.",Tacoma,0
"Charming cute cabin, superhost","We enjoyed another pleasant stay at Geneva's cabin. It's perfectly located to our planned activities and is easy to get to and from. It's a cute, cozy, and very clean cottage/cabin. We appreciate that Geneva makes it fragrance free, and has fragrance free products so people like us who suffer from chemical sensitivities can avoid hotels and feel like you're home. The kitchen is well supplied with pots, pans, utensils for cooking meals and this time we even bbq'd! She also stocks the freezer with coffees and gluten free breads! Geneva is quick to respond to messages and flexible. A great superhost!",Tacoma,0
"Charming cute cabin, superhost","Jeneva’s cabin was so wonderful to stay in! I really liked all of the sticky notes, those were extremely helpful especially for the shower. Unfortunately, we were gone most of the days really early and got back later in the day so we didn’t have time to meet her, but was super helpful at answering my questions via inbox.  We were in a construction zone, so we had to reroute ourselves but that’s my only small complaint! Our stay here was great, Jeneva had a lot of essentials - extra towels (which we didn’t end up using), extra food, a water filter, pretty much anything you could need. We didn’t use much of her things only because we bought groceries and our own things to use.  Would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Washington!",Tacoma,0
"Charming cute cabin, superhost","The cabin was an excellent place for us to stop for a night before flying home after a holiday visit to the Northwest. It was tucked away in a residential neighborhood, but easy to transition back to the interstate. We loved all the special touches that Jeneva had added to the cabin. The kitchen and living room more charming, and the beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed both dinner and breakfast in the cozy kitchen, and would’ve been happy to stay for more days if our travel plans had allowed. A wonderful retreat!",Tacoma,0
"Aloha Tiny House, Dash Point","My son and I stayed here while in the area for a night. We loved our time in Tony and Attina's tiny house. They did an amazing job with the small space--very cute beach/island theme inside. Everything was clean and ready for us. Any time I reached out, they responded immediately. The views off of the deck were incredible. Please note this is a legit tiny house, so would not recommend if there is more than one or two of you. Next time we're down in the area, we'll definitely be checking availability here. Thank you!",Tacoma,0
"Aloha Tiny House, Dash Point","This is truly a 'tiny' house.  I am a person of significant size, and this space was perfect for just me.  If my 6'2"" husband had been along with me, it would have been a bit too tight.  But that being said, the guest register reflected that many other couples had stayed there and were perfectly comfortable.  No. More than that.  They LOVED the tiny house!  As an individual guest, I found this space to be absolutely perfect.  Tony and Attina have  laid out the minimal space in such a way that all needs were met -- beyond what I had expected.  And sitting out on their deck on a cool spring evening was just the ""bee's knees"".  I TOTALLY recommend this sweet location to anyone wanting to give themselves an extra overnight treat.",Tacoma,0
"Aloha Tiny House, Dash Point","Beautiful. Thought out. Sparkling Clean. Cozy. Warm. Friendly. Comfortable bed and plenty of pillows! Pretty much everything you could dream of for a tiny house! This was our first tiny house stay and it blew us away. Tony and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. We met briefly, in the driveway once and they were courteous and warm, but didn't keep us around to talk but let us go on our to dinner without any fuss. Can't recommend enough. My husband and I just needed a night away and this place was private and cozy, exactly what we needed. Oh, and don't miss the view!",Tacoma,0
"Aloha Tiny House, Dash Point","This place was great! Amazing view and perfect for snuggling! We got in around check in time, they had everything we needed to enjoy our time at the house, snacks, water, and a fridge. We enjoyed the view from the deck before we got dressed and headed to a lovely dinner at the Cliff House. We then came back to enjoy the view after dark and were able to watch some Netflix before heading to bed. Amenities were great and my husband was so glad they had an extra toiletries since he forgot his toothbrush. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a night or a couple nights in a beautiful and intimate spot. Wish we could have stayed longer.",Tacoma,0
"Aloha Tiny House, Dash Point","This place is awesome. Small? Yes. But it's called the tiny house! any bigger, and it might lose the charm. Great view, easy to find. Comfortable everything. During check in, I dropped part of the key's lock box off the deck and into the neighbor's yard. I contact Tony and Anita to ask what I should do. Within ten minutes, Tony was there with a replacement, and told me not to worry about it. While he was at it, he replaced the propane tank on the grill for me. If you want your host to take care of you and be there if you need anything, then look no further than Tony and Anita. They (and their tiny house) are awesome.",Tacoma,0
"Aloha Tiny House, Dash Point",Unfortunately we didn’t get to spend very much time here. I wish we would have had a longer stay so we could enjoy this cozy space longer. This is a real tiny house definitely a space for one or two people. It was perfect for my boyfriend and I. The loft was very cozy and comfy. The ladder has grippers to help when climbing up and down. It was very adorable. We arrived late driving down from Poulsbo after spending time with family on Easter. It was late and we had no problem getting settled in when we arrived. We were pooped and called it a night. When we woke up the view was amazing! We had some coffee and just relaxed for the morning. It was lovely. The Neighborhood felt very safe and quiet.,Tacoma,0
"Aloha Tiny House, Dash Point","This tiny house was fantastic!  Even driving up, it’s beauty hit us from the get go. The flower vines were in bloom, the view walking up onto the deck and the details of decor even on the outside let us know this place was special! There was enough space to have a wonderful stay in a fun house with every amenity!  It is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, cozy and the linens are top notch. Tony and Attina were there as needed, friendly when we saw them and eager to make our stay fantastic, even giving us a late check out which was very much appreciated.  The beaches and parks are a short drive and the history of the area was fun to discover. Stay here if ever in the area.",Tacoma,0
"Aloha Tiny House, Dash Point",The Aloha house is simply perfect! Everything you need in a small but still cozy place!  Warm welcome even if we didn't have the opportunity to meet Troy and Attina. Communications were clear and responses came quite quickly and were loaded with useful informations about the house and also about our visit in Seattle.  I was an Airbnb newbie and they guided me well throughout the process!  Wouldn't hesitate to book it again!!  Thank you Troy and Attina for making our honeymoon trip starts so wonderfully!!

Affordable Private Suite with Laundry Sleeps 4,"Luke was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The bed is very comfortable and a thoughtful variety of pillows, from softer to firm. The futon included a couple of foam toppers which made it very comfortable for my daughter. The neighbor felt safe, kids playing basketball, couples taking walks chatting over the fence, the smell off Bbqs. A little patio to have coffee and watch the birds was nice. Very clean! A. Large selection of games, books, local magazines, and a Wii. Overall a great airbnb, as described, and would stay there again! Thanks luke!",Tacoma,0
Affordable Private Suite with Laundry Sleeps 4,"Very comfortable and cute space. GREAT bed! Awesome covered sitting outside. Without an oven, cooktop, or even a toaster oven, I don’t recommend staying longer than a day otherwise you have to try to find somewhere to eat every meal. And there’s not many great choices since it’s Federal Way. The shower is also very small and hard to use and I’m 5’4 and 100 pounds. No amenities really to speak of. Things like bathroom supplies, shampoo, conditioner, q-tips, bandaids, toothpaste or toothbrushs, etc. Not sure if the hosts leave their house whenever they have guests but you do have to enter the host’s main house in order to get to your place downstairs, so that’s a little weird. Overall, it was a great stay for a single night.",Tacoma,0
Affordable Private Suite with Laundry Sleeps 4,"Luke is prompt to communicate - super helpful when arriving after dark and it's hard to the see the house numbers in the neighborhood.  At Luke's place, you get the entire basement so you won't feel cramped at all.  The neighborhood appears quite safe - no concerns at all.  It is quite close to several state and city parks along the shore of Puget Sound.  The bed is comfy with plenty of blankets to keep warm.  The bathroom is plenty sufficient.  It was nice to have a big dining table plus a couch with coffee table to allow space to read and work.  Definitely recommend if you need a place to stay in metro Seattle.",Tacoma,0
Affordable Private Suite with Laundry Sleeps 4,"Luke’s place is simply the best value for an entire space listing all around the Puget Sound. The pictures just don’t depict the quality and value you’ll receive. My friends and I were blown away. Luke is a perfect host as well. As an experienced host myself with the experience of hosting more than 2,700 guests in 2.5 years, I can say that he is a professional and does everything exactly like it should be done. I learned about a lot of things I can add and improve upon after staying here. Thanks Luke!",Tacoma,0
Affordable Private Suite with Laundry Sleeps 4,"We loved this location and appreciated the quiet neighborhood with the conveniency of being minutes from the airport. Due to our travel arrangements we arrived late and left early and so we were grateful for our understanding hosts as well as the ease of access. The space was large and cozy with several extra amenities. But the bed, after traveling all over Washington and B.C. was amazingly comfortable! We certainly needed a good rest and the pillows and linens were great. I'd love to stay again if I ever find myself in the Seattle Tacoma area. ",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"Not to make this sound cheesy, but Where do I begin, with how wonderful this bnb was!? This was our first bnb experience and I only hope all are as nice! First off she is very easy to communicate with from the initial request to the day you leave. Since we had never been to a bnb we had many questions and she was very knowledgeable.  We had our own private oasis to say it best! Our own parking space ro start right in front of your area. She offers you your own deck with comfy chairs and a beautiful yard and a view of puget sound. You walk in to a modestly charming modern looking living room, with still a perfect view of the water and large chairs and couch. Everything was spotlessly clean and she offers everything in her cute little kitchen you might need. She adds may small charming little touches we didnt expect and were so grateful. I highly recommend staying here!",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"Book this place now! Marcia’s place was absolutely wonderful - from the view, food/ snack selection, special touches, to just a homey space. Everything was remarkably clean and everything we would ever need was available to us. The view from the patio is spectacular. Communication was great, Marcia got back to us within minutes of reaching out. Even letting us know that we can check in early. If you are looking for a private, homey space this is perfect for you! Thank you Marcia for your amazing hospitality.",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"I don’t ever write the views but I was compelled to let you view review for Marcia’s place. Everything about it was beautiful: the location ,  the view, the ability to see the view, the outside living space, We were welcomed by a complimentary tray of wine and snacks. She communicated quickly and efficiently each time I contacted her. She lives upstairs but you never know she’s there unless you contact her.  I would highly recommend this place such a joy every treatment self and very affordable priced",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),Just stop right now. And book. I just spend three nights at Shipwatch for a personal retreat and I feel so refreshed and rejuvenated. The location is great for walks and getting to the beach. Marcia shared some tips on best time of day to go which was helpful so I could collect some shells for my kids!  The snack cart was super helpful and made the place feel more homey! The bed was cozy and the Alexa was helpful because I always fall asleep to music and I forgot my Bluetooth speaker. So glad Alexa could lullaby me to . I actually rebooked her place before I even got three because she was booked out months in advance. I figured if all these reviews were wrong I had 48 hours to cancel — and sure enough every review was true true true. Her place is a treasure.,Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"If you’re looking at this and this space is still available, stop what you’re doing and reserve it. Then come back and read all of the 5-star reviews! Shipwatch Retreat is a beautiful, stylish and comfortable place for a break from the mundane or if you want as much out of your lodging as you do from your visit to WA. Close to Dash Point State Park with views of the water, Vashon Island and the Olympic Mountains you will not find a more luxurious and well stocked home.  We will definitely return!",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"The Ship Watch was amazing! The view was to die for!! We had a little issue the shower only have lukewarm water because she literally had a bathroom remodeled before we arrived. Even though that wasn’t her fault, she kindly refunded us a generous amount to compensate for the inconvenience. She was quick to answer and had everything we could even want! We loved the snacks that she provided as well as the convince of the honor bar that was fully stocked! We can’t wait to go back! This stay was amazing!!",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"We had an amazing stay at the Shipwatch retreat! The space is clean, bright, and comfortable, with wonderful big windows that look out on the water.  You can lie in bed and look out and see ships go by - it's just perfect for a lazy, low-key morning.  Marcia has thought of every detail, from chilled beverages in the fridge to an extra-soft blanket for snuggling on the couch. She's included restaurant recommendations (the takeout teriyaki we picked up was wonderful!) and and plenty of complimentary teas, coffee, and snacks -- PLUS the most amazing, well-stocked snack bar available for cash/ (Hidden by Airbnb) . What a total treat to be able to stay in instead of going out in search of something to nibble on.  There are even hummingbird feeders right outside the window which make for the most cheerful view.  The bed is cozy and the towels are super soft.  We were only able to stay for a night but we would absolutely love to come back!  Thank you for providing such a peaceful, restful space for a little pre-baby getaway!",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"We had the best stay at Marcia's beautiful studio! You can tell she puts a lot of thought into her guests' visits. The studio had everything we needed and more! The views were amazing, and everything inside is new, clean and in great condition. The TV is hooked up to Netflix and Amazon Prime, so we had all the entertainment we needed. We were pleasantly surprised to see that Marcia had setup a donation-based snack and drink bar. Throughout our five night stay this came in very handy when we were tired from the day's events and didn't feel like driving to a local market. I wish we could have stayed longer! We would love to stay here again on our next visit to Tacoma!",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"This was the final Airbnb location to our 10 days vacay in Washington and Vancouver. Honestly, this couldn’t have been anymore perfect to top of our last weekend before heading back home.  We knew what type of place we were heading into from the photos, but when we actually arrived  we were so surprised on how beautiful this place was in person. Lucky for us, the sun was out this week so we got a beautiful view of the water, and Marcia was kind enough to let us see more of the view from her own balcony.   The room itself had a warm welcoming feeling. She provided a lot of info on where to eat close by, and where to shop. She was kind enough to provide snacks and drinks that we took advantage and ended up staying in on our last day watching a football game on her big Screen tv.   Overall, I highly recommend this place if you’re looking for a peaceful getaway. Marcia is a fantastic host with great communication. I hope I get to return again in the future!",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"I have been to many airb bnbs across the world, and this is the one I have felt most welcomed at. Marcia has though of everything in terms of hospitality: easy check in, snacks and wine at your leisure, and a beautiful, waterfront meticulous, cozy place. We had our own parking area and a welcome sign—My husband and I even joked, wondering if Marcia wanted some roommates!!! It’s a very private place that is well put together—I would be so happy to stay here again and would definitely recommend it to a family or friend staying in the  area. What a wonderful place.",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"We had a marvelous stay at Marcia's place. Not only was the space adorable and the views fantastic, but Marcia was truly a host who went above and beyond to make our stay spectacular. When we had trouble w our car, she offered to drive us 30 minutes to take care of the issue. We can not thank her enough for this generosity. Waking up to the views of the sound was wonderful and she has thought of everything to make a special stay, from the snacks to the cozy blankets that I wanted to take home with me. Would give this 10 stars if I could!",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"Marcia’s place is relaxing and a clean spot for 1-2 people or a small family.   The views are just as advertised and checkin was super simple. Kitchen was well equipped and has nice appliances and countertops. The TV is great place to relax after a long day hiking or exploring!  The location is a bit off the beaten path and there’s not a ton of restaurants close by but there are a few and some with views out on the water. It’s only about 20-30 mins to Tacoma depending on traffic so you have options just be prepared to drive or Uber.   I would definitely recommend staying here, Marcia has many nice touches and the unit is private and a good price.",Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),Marcia was a wonderfull host and made our stay memorable. A severe snow storm came through Tacoma while we were staying and she made sure we had breakfast and gave advice when it was best to continue on our journey. The apartment was perfect and Marcia provided extra snacks which came in handy as we arrived late. Loved the humming birds. Came to the feeding station in the middle of the snow storm. When the storm subsided the view across the bay was astounding. Wish we  could have spent more time at The Shipwatch Retreat. Marcia provided great American hospitality.  Sue and Herb,Tacoma,0
The Shipwatch Retreat (air conditioned),"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at the end of September and it was more then we could of expected. I have stayed at many Airbnb...this one tops my list. Marica was quick to respond to messages and she added so many personal touches to our stay.  She added many extra thoughtful items to make you stay feel welcomed and comfy. We would return to stay again. plus we highlyrecommend this place for others.  Some extra thoughts on the place.... I love Alexa (I'm new to her)  The bed was very comfy.  Loved the extra blankets to snuggle up on the couch.  TV is HUGH! lol   The drinks and snacks where great added touch.  Location to Seattle...about 1hr drive to Pike Place Market.  Beautifulview, and quiet neighborhood.  Thanks again for offering a wonderful place to stay.",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"Susan’s home was our first Airbnb experience. We weren’t sure what to expect but she was there to greet us and as she walked us through her home I was absolutely floored! She pays attention to every detail, and you can tell that she LOVES what she’s doing because it is clear that heart and soul went into making this space a truly charming experience for any houseguest. She provided snacks and food, coffee, and beverages. Everything was so comfortable and at the end of a long day exploring we came home early just to rest in what was quite possibly one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever been in. Thanks Susan! We were pampered and spoiled and are eternally grateful for the experience!",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"Susan's Proctor Airbnb in Tacoma, Washington is absolutely wonderful.  Everything was so nice---easy to locate, good parking, immaculately clean, great snacks and breakfast foods, beds were very comfortable with great bedding.    Susan was very thorough --- no questions were left unanswered.  The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated and Susan left little notes everywhere explaining everything from where the extra toilet paper was to whether or not the fruit was washed and how to use the TV remotes and Wi-Fi.    She had snacks for us and a great breakfast.  I will definitely contact Susan again if I need a place to stay in Tacoma.",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"Susan does so many lovely things for her guests.  All the things you want - good communication, easy check in and out, convenient parking, a beautiful and comfortable space to call ""home"" for awhile.  But to all this she adds plush robes and slippers, loads of fluffy towels, television and streaming channel options, and shelves of books if you'd like to explore something you haven't before. And then she goes beyond all that and stocks the fridge with delicious foods, thoughtfully selected, so you can enjoy your breakfast or a snack and get a ""taste"" of the local fare.  You won't find a more thoughtful or helpful host or a lovelier space for you stay.",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"Susan’s place was an absolute gem. I travel a lot for work and have stayed in many Airbnb’s, and Susan has been, by far, the most attentive and generous host ever! The apartment was spotless, and absolutely every detail had been thought of including fresh pastries from an independent coffee shop and breakfast items to make it easy for those needing to grab something as they walk out the door.   Best Airbnb ever AND the area is absolutely beautiful if you want to walk toward the water to look at a sunset one night! Check out Rosewood Cafe on your way for a casual but yummy meal!   Thanks, Susan. ",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"This is a very cheerful, immaculately clean and bright basement apartment. There is an entry room with couch, then walk through the main bedroom/living area to get to the dining room/kitchen, and at the end of the kitchen is the bathroom. Susan provided us with local baked yummies, coffee, teas, juice, milks, fruits, oatmeal, yogurts, boiled eggs- very well stocked for breakfast. But no cooking, so we ate out for lunch and dinner, called ubereats once. Some really great food choices around here, it was easy to feed 4 of us either out or in the apartment. Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at. Susan made us feel as though we were the only people to have ever slept, showered or ate there, it really is that clean. The apartment has incredibly thoughtful touches throughout, all the luxury amenities one could need. Great smells, poofy robes, but tight shower. Susan is incredibly attentive, accommodating of your needs, but respectful of your privacy. I've stayed at 3 airbnb's in Tacoma and this is by far the best deal, and tickled my inner clean freak so much. And thank you, Susan, for accommodating us an extra day!",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"After spending 11 nights at Susan's place, I can tell you the suite is great. It's quiet, spacious and spotless. The neighborhood is nice and walking distance to the Univ of Puget Sound. The entrance and foyer are ground level with parking right in front. The rest of the suite is basement level so there is less natural light. However interior lighting is terrific and keeps the rooms very bright.  I was there during a heat wave and while there's no air conditioning, fans kept the rooms cool.  I highly recommend this place.",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"The neighboring streets are delightful, the decor in Susan and Khahn’s lovely suite is perfect, but what takes this place above and beyond the norm are the thoughtful touches Susan has added for each moment. From earplugs, water and caramels by the bed, ( both sides!!) cozy bedding,  flowers, treats, best yogurt, pastries, fresh blueberries, mango, on and on...and, as others have said, the carefully placed notes to inform, we loved the place, and could feel Susan’s care in wanting to make it all that a get away suite could possibly be.  How great is that?! Thanks, Susan!",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"Our stay at Susan's place was amazing.  I've been to many AirBNB's and with many Superhosts, but the attention to detail and the thoughtful touches that she had were outstanding.  As a guest, you get the feeling that she really cares about your stay and wants you to be as comfortable and happy as possible.  She had fun little touches all over the space, with helpful little notes that anticipated any question or need we might have.  The food she had for us was top quality and she even bought my daughter a birthday cake (we were in Tacoma celebrating her 21st birthday!).  I hope to return there again on our next trip!",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"This is by far the *BEST* place we've ever stayed. Not only is the house perfectly located in the charming Proctor District, Susan creates an immaculate, spacious home that could be featured in House Beautiful magazine or HGTV.   She is the consummate host--not only is she extremely responsive and respectful of her guests, she provides for your every need: she left us gourmet goodies in the kitchen from local shoppes, fresh washed seasonal fruit, and stocked the fridge with everything we could've ever wanted for breakfast.   She has impeccable attention to detail - from her fresh flower arrangement, a colorful collection of local guidebooks and personal recommendations, an iPad to use (loaded with apps to find local things to do), to bedside water carafes filled with filtered water on a tray with sealed personal earplugs and local handmade caramels.   Susan saw to it that we had everything and more. There's no wonder why she's called a SUPERHOST and always booked! From now on, whenever we revisit the Seattle area, we will definitely look to stay here first!",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"We are not AirBnB veterans, only having used it a couple of times, with somewhat mixed results. If it were like this every time, we would use it a LOT more. Pictures are accurate, and if anything kind of undersell the place. It’s more spacious than it looks. Charming, and comfortable basement suite. Lots of thoughtful touches like fresh half and half for the coffee, fresh fruit, local ice cream and pastries...   The queen size bed is comfy and clean, but a bit on the firm side. (Which I prefer. My wife prefers a softer bed, but she says it was comfortable enough, and she slept well.) Multiple pillow options too. Good size kitchen and dining area. No cooking, but there is a microwave. Who wants to cook on vacation, anyway? Walkable shopping/dining/drinks options. Susan's communication is fast and friendly if you were to have a problem. Which we didn’t.   Some reviews have mentioned footsteps upstairs. Our hosts were out of town, so I can’t comment on that. It was very quiet, in a quiet and gorgeous neighborhood.   If this is available when you’re in town, and close to where you want to stay, book it before someone else does. We would definitely stay here again.",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"This was one of the best, if not THE best Air BnBs we have ever stayed in. The space is much larger than the pictures make it appear, with a full dining area, ample kitchen (for breakfasts and take-out dinners), and a super comfortable bed! The kitchen was stocked with goodies for us for breakfast (and some candies for treats)—there must have been at least $40 worth of groceries in there for us to use. Very generous, thank you!! Excellent location and just perfect for a weekend get-away visiting friends.",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"Susan was AMAZING!! My parents were visiting from out of town for their first trip to the Seattle/Tacoma area and to meet my fiance for the first time. This was also their first stay in an Airbnb, which they were a little hesitant about. But after checking-in and spending one night at Susan's place, they were hooked for life!  Susan preemptively asked about any special likes or dislikes my parent and then went above and beyond to provide great touches like pastries from a wonderful local bakery, coffee, fruit, etc. My parents were blown away and had an amazing time! This will be their go-to place to stay whenever they come back out to visit.",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"The first thing I will say is: Book Susan's place! You will not be sorry. The space is very comfortable and spacious and spotlessly clean.  The communication with Susan is prompt and friendly. The location is perfect - very quiet neighborhood yet 3 blocks to UPS and close to Proctor shops.  But the thing that puts her place over the top is her attention to detail.  Hardboiled eggs, yogurt and OJ in the fridge.  Granola and fresh fruit and goodies from a nearby bakery.  A touch of chocolate and bedside caramels.  And little handwritten notes everywhere.  It is clear that Susan enjoys being an airbnb host and truly cares about her guests.",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"After a day of driving, shlepping, packing/unpacking, cleaning, and generally helping my student move into or out of the dorm, what a joy it is to arrive at Susan and Khanh's home. Peaceful, spotless, welcoming, the music is softly playing and the stress is gone. I find their helpful notes, discover indulgent treats, and settle in to the comfort of this wonderful  BnB. ""Above and beyond"" expectations is clearly their motto. This is my third visit, and it's always even better than I remembered. Quiet, spacious, comfortable, close to everything in the north end, with everything you need, plus so many sweet and thoughtful extras. They are the perfect hosts. I’ve already booked my next visit in May. Thank you for hosting me again. ",Tacoma,0

A really WONDERFUL experience!!",Tacoma,0
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"Susan was a  warm and very welcoming host, who offered many thoughtful touches to this apartment: food in the fridge, plenty of towels and blankets, and lots of suggestions for visiting Tacoma well presented in a booklet.  The neighbourhood is quiet, the apartment immaculate, and the bed was Very Comfortable (so much so that we had a full night's sleep, even with jet lag!!)  We enjoyed our stay, though it might be a little pricey for the space; it is essentially a well appointed basement apartment where no cooking is allowed. (this is where the four stars kicked in) There were plenty of delicious treats however, and a microwave is in the kitchen for warming up take-away food.",Tacoma,0
Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"Amazing loft with about a 12 minute ride to downtown Tacoma. The loft felt like a home and we found it hard to want to leave at times. The quaint little charm this place has will make you want to live there full time. Every time we go back to Tacoma in the future, we will be staying here. We initially were going to stay for just 2 nights, but our plans required for a longer stay and Jeanna was more than accommodating  When we tried extending our stay, we had issues with the Airbnb website and Jeanna was so understanding and caring about the issue we were having. Couldn’t have asked for a better host.",Tacoma,0
Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"We were impressed by the design of this place -- an ingenious use of space!  The kitchen and living areas are comfortable (only two chairs at the table, though) and nicely decorated.  Communication with Jeanna was fabulous -- we had a couple of small issues, and she addressed them immediately.  A few notes for the faint of heart: The stairs leading up to the space are indeed steep (worth it, we thought).  The bed is under the eaves, so watch your head!  The bathroom is part of the bedroom, with no door separating the two, though the toilet is mostly hidden behind the sink, and there is a door between the bedroom and the living room.  The only reason we'd hesitate to stay again is that the bed was too soft for us, but everything else was lovely.",Tacoma,0
Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"Thank you so much for the cozy stay here in Tacoma! It remained nice and warm inside even as it snowed. We didn’t even have to wear socks to keep warm! We had fun flipping through your “Books of Knowledge” on your bookcase and laughed as some passages seemed more like common sense. The bed was incredibly soft and comfortable. I definitely enjoyed the amount of pillows provided, as I’m quite picky with them and I found juuuuuust the right one. The kitchenette was definitely one of our favorite parts of the loft (aside from the gorgeous shower). We had to (Hidden by Airbnb) how to work the little stove heater (we didn’t realize the pan/pot needed to be on the surface before it would work) but hey! We figured it out and we were stoked that it ended up working faster than my stovetop at home! Trent was ecstatic that you had three different contraptions to brew coffee (he prefers the French press) and did a very childish happy dance when he saw you had fancy sugar cubes. Thank you for providing tea, by the way. A lot of Airbnbs provide coffee, but rarely do I see black tea! It was nice to enjoy the views of the Sound and admire the beech tree on your property to a nice cup of tea/coffee. We were kind of thankful it was still winter and wondered if we would even be able to see the sound when your neighbors’ trees bloom back with leaves! We really appreciated all the little details you put in to make this spot special.       -Dakota & Trent",Tacoma,0
Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"We were blown away with how comfortable we felt staying here! The loft was a perfect size for two, with great amenities in the kitchen, a  cozy living space with an electric fireplace under the TV, an awesome shower, and the most comfortable bed I’ve probably ever slept in. My boyfriend and I had zero complaints about staying here and were sad to leave! It was also wonderful being so close to Point Defiance, we went to Anthony’s (4 minute drive) right next to the park and had great seafood with a beautiful view, and went for a beautiful hike on a different day. I think it would be hard to find a better place to stay in Tacoma!",Tacoma,0
Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"This spacious attic apartment is a special place to stay, and makes you want to plant yourself in its cozy embrace and enjoy all its charms.  I liken it to house-sitting for your girlfriend, who has magazine-worthy taste in antique collecting and design!   Jeanna was a splendid host, and did everything to make our stay so easy and comfortable.  We appreciated the added kindness of coffee and snacks along with all the kitchen equipment we could want.  Linens were comfortable and plentiful.  The mattress is on the soft side, and as my husband and I do better with a firm mattress,  I had  a bit of trouble sleeping without rolling downhill towards him!  Appreciated the easy keycode lock and a parking spot reserved just for us.  Located in a beautiful neighborhood with quick  access to all of Tacoma's many, many attractions, this apartment is simply a fantastic, well-appointed, relaxing  getaway!!",Tacoma,0
Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"Jeanna's place was absolute perfection. The space was cozy and a wonderful home away from home. My husband and I brought our 9 month old son with us and even with the stairs it was perfect; an attached baby gate was provided at the top of the stairs so no tumbles were possible. The space was bright and airy while being a cozy nook all at the same time, the plethora of blankets and pillows was amazing. The kitchenette was wonderful and had everything we needed and then some. We were greeted with a personalized message at the front door which was a lovely touch, and Jeanna was exceptionally welcoming and friendly.

Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"Cozy and comfy! We loved our stay at Jeanna's, the place really felt like a home to us. She had a chalkboard sign on her front door saying ""Welcome Jason!"" which my wife loved, it made us feel like we were wanted as guests.  Lots of windows and natural sunlight, the bed was very comfortable, and the shower was amazing.  Jeanna is great as well. She provided great instructions ahead of our check-in and communicated to us on our third day about potential Internet problems as she was having some service done.

The kitchen is well-stocked, and we had a wonderful weekend relaxing, watching TV, and thumbing through the travel books on the shelf.  The neighborhood is full of grand old homes and we loved going for an evening stroll and admiring everyone's gardens.  Jeanna's place is a 20-minute walk to the waterfront, and about a $10-$12 Lyft ride to downtown, where there are plenty of fun bars and restaurants to choose from.

Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"The home is lovely! Things to note: We didn’t see any place to open a window in the bedroom (open window was in kitchen area) but luckily it wasn’t TOO warm. We were able to turn on some fans. Also the ceilings above bed are low/vaulted so even at 5’3” it was a bit annoying to get in and out of bed. BUT I saw pictures so I knew this was a possibility.

Every detail has been thought out for making it an enjoyable stay.  The picturesque location is perfect!  I could have stared out the kitchen nook window for hours. Jeanna was more than accommodating even before we arrived.  If you’re on the fence about booking this place, just book it! The stairs, while noted are steep, aren’t that bad coming from two people who are overpackers.  It’s well worth the climb when you see this amazing loft!  We spent three nights here and our only complaint was we didn’t book it for longer.  We would love to come back and plan on it in the future!",Tacoma,0
Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"My daughter and I had a great experience staying at Jeanna’s adorable attic apartment in her beautiful Victorian house. The space is large, cozy and nicely furnished with a lovely kitchen that has a window view of the Sound peaking through the trees. Very clean and quiet. I was visiting my daughter who goes to University of Puget Sound so this is about a 10 minute or less drive from her campus. The neighborhood is very cute and quiet. We drove to the places we needed to go so I am not sure if it was in walking distance to any restaurants or coffee shops. But Jeanna supplied coffee and granola bars so we were set in the morning. A couple things that you may consider that were not big problems for us but may not be perfect for other travelers: there is one big comfy bed in the bedroom and the bathroom is in the same room without a privacy door. So if you need privacy in the bathroom you have to ask your traveling companion to leave the bedroom. And like the description says there are a couple of steep stair cases. Not a problem for us but if you have a lot of heavy luggage it would be something to consider.",Tacoma,0
Revamped Loft in Historical Victorian with Porch,"We had a wonderful stay at what has proven to be one of the best of many terrific AirBNB experiences. We were spending time with a child at University of Puget Sound, and it was an easy drive back and forth to campus. The neighborhood is quaint and quiet, and the space was marvelous. Of particular note was a most excellent shower - an area that can be shoehorned in at some other places, especially when the rental has been crafted out of a basement or attic. This shower was spacious, clean, substantial, with great water pressure.",Tacoma,0
Lovely Craftsman - Private Bedroom,"Linda and her house are very warm and welcoming.  A great place to decompress and relax.  Super quiet neighborhood with 6th just two blocks away.  Wouldn’t even know it.   We stayed for two nights, Linda was very accommodating and checking in and out was a breeze.  Her place was sparkling clean, comfortable and the décor was spot on.   We enjoyed our morning conversations over coffee with Linda in the common area.  What a great place to stay if you get a chance to book it.  It was our first Airbnb experience and we loved it, and hope to visit again.",Tacoma,0
Lovely Craftsman - Private Bedroom,"Linda's place is very central in Tacoma, easy to find, 2 blocks from a great little restaurant, quick drive to downtown and the museums.  Bed and pillows were comfy; the private bathroom had a bathtub with shower.  Wifi was fast.  There were snacks and a bottle of water in the bedroom (no plastic - yeah!).  The kitchen was new, and Linda made space in her freezer so we could refreeze our ice for the ice chest.  The neighborhood was quiet and her house is lovely.  Linda was very friendly but gave us total privacy.  Couldn't ask for anything more.",Tacoma,0
Lovely Craftsman - Private Bedroom,"A nicely decorated home with a very relaxed vibe. Welcoming and comfortable common areas especially the kitchen island. The neighborhood was quiet except for the occasional neigborhood children laughing and somobody playing saxaphone in the evening! (loved both). Linda recommended a groovy grocery store called Stadium Thriftway, that was just a short drive from the home. AMAZING! My lady and I took an evening stroll down 6th street and perused the many restaurants and shops. Though we didn't dine, ASADO looked intriguing as did the Vietnamese restaurant (name escapes me). The quaint pubs and vintage shops along 6th ave were closed for the night but looked promising. I wish we could've spent a bit more time in the area to pop into the local shops.",Tacoma,0
Lovely Craftsman - Private Bedroom,"This home has everything you need during your stay in Tacoma. Linda has beautiful flowering plants outside and comfortable decor inside. We loved the natural light that flows through the house because of all the windows. Her kitchen is well equipt to meet anyone's needs. We love the oversized bathtub/shower!  Notes about the bedroom -  1) The bed and pillows are super comfy!  We slept wonderfully. 2) Her house has no AC but the fan was great for the unseasonable hot weather during our stay. 3) Thin curtains above the bed caused the bedroom to be lighter than we are used to as soon as we fell asleep, it was no problem.    Don't hesitate to stay at Linda's VERY reasonably price and comfy home.",Tacoma,0
Lovely Craftsman - Private Bedroom,"Linda's place is the sort that I  love about AirBnB; clean, a bit eccentric, quiet, & ""comfy"". I'm a 60's guy, and this suited me to perfection.  I almost passed up on using my reservation because I was ahead of schedule and could have made home that night, but I'm so glad I didn't; it is such a serene place to spend some time.  I think my best endorsement that I can say about it is that I would happily live here!   Linda is a lovely person, and her puppy is brilliant!   What more could you ask for? 6 stars (out of 5)",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"We decided to visit Tacoma from nearby Seattle and Brian and Hillary's loft was the perfect home base for exploring this up-and-coming city. The loft was very spacious, comfortable and surprisingly quiet for being so close to the ports and trains. It's a pleasent 15-minute walk downtown along Pacific Avenue but there are also good food options (and a great book store) within just a few blocks. We'll definitely stay here again if their space is available during our next visit to Tacoma. Thanks again Brian and Hillary for making our ""stay-cation"" so comfortable and memorable. D+N",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"A very warm welcome and very inviting and unique space. Friendly notes around the space helped with any questions we had and a binder gave more detailed information plus tips on where to go and places to eat. The loft was absolutely spotless, beautifully and tastefully furnished, and really fun (games, puzzles, pool table, music, and even a scooter!) If you plan to do all your cooking there, you might feel limited as there is just a hotplate, microwave and toaster oven in the kitchen, but it is enough for simple meals. Well located for downtown Tacoma, the Glass Museum, and Point Defiance Park. This is an urban setting with typical urban noise except that the train tracks are very close and when a train comes through the noise is pretty loud. Host provides ear plugs which is a nice touch for those of us who are not deep sleepers! My family loved it.",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"This is the second time my family has stayed at Brian and Hillary's amazing space in Tacoma and we loved it! Such a creative, open, beautiful space with lots of fun amenities! My daughters played pool, on the Wii, did homework on the computer and we had fun listening to music on the record player provided! The space is so clean and the location is so handy when attending events at the Tacoma Dome. Brian and Hillary are so responsive and kind and make checking in and out so very easy. We look forward to staying again in 2019!",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"If you are going to a concert in Tacoma this is the place to be.  The Tacoma Done is right up the street; you cannot beat the location.  The loft is a full floor of open space with lots of natural light.  There are so many unique touches and amenities.  We enjoyed listening to the albums on their turntable, and we used their projector to watch some YouTube videos.  We hung out at their beautifully lit bar.  They have books and games and artsy coloring books! We didn’t even get around to playing pool on the pool table. No guest should ever be bored here.",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"This is a very cool, unique space.  Its a chic oasis in the middle of a somewhat industrial part of town.  The place is a large open loft, but they have furnished it so feels quite warm and welcoming - in a very hip sort of way.  There are some nice amenities like an overhead projector, kitchen, games, drawing table, bar area.  I arrived to the place late both nights I stayed and felt very safe.  Access was easy and secure.  Very clean.  Everything I needed for a couple nights in Tacoma.  And fun to look around at the art they are creating in the space when its not being rented to outside folks.",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"The loft was a fantastic place for hanging out, playing some pool, watching some movies and just relaxing.  The location worked well since my son was in Seattle the night before so had a quick walk from the Amtrak station stop in Tacoma to the apartment.  Easy access to the highway was convenient and worked well for us.  Our only wish, was that it was in a location that had some more food/drink options and more foot traffic to feel safer.  Happily, we were more focused on spending time to catch up since my son and I are on opposite coasts, and hanging at the loft provided us that...even though our pool skills could use some work!  Thanks for a great stay!",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"This loft was bigger and better than I even imagined! The twinkling lights and thoughtful decor made the huge space seem cozy and inviting, and there was plenty of space to spread out and relax. There were little notes all over the space to let me know which things I could use (a fun sketching table, puzzles, and a big projector to watch Netflix and play my favorite playlists!) The atmosphere Brian and Hillary have brought to this loft is fun and I'd recommend it to anyone with some artistic flair who wants a getaway near the Tacoma dome!",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"This peaceful, beautiful studio made us feel transported into a different life. There were sweet little surprises everywhere: a record player and exciting record collection, super cozy beds, romantic twinkle lights, games, puzzles, wise handwritten quotes, unique handmade furniture, fascinating screen printing supplies, ect. Though it wasn’t far from home, it truly was the restful weekend away that my friends and I needed. If you are looking for a break from the buzz of life, I can’t recommend this studio highly enough. I really hope to stay here again. Thank you for sharing a part of your world with us Brian and Hillary!",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"This has to be my favorite Airbnb experience to date. The loft is very spacious, stylish, comfortable, surprisingly private despite the location, and secure. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom up-to-date with an excellent shower, very clean… We had everything we needed. Brian and Hillary were very helpful, checking in by text to make sure all was well.  The downtown location was very convenient to some local sites, and also easy to get to UPS (college kid drop off trip). We hope to have the opportunity to stay there again in the future.",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"What a FANTASTIC space!  So beautifully appointed, and such great style.  The plants, the lights, the hammock!  All fantastic.  The loft is very open and there is tons of light (all of the widows do have fancy pull down shades if you like to sleep in).  The space is advertised as a little noisy, but I found I hardly noticed the traffic or the trains (if you are very noise sensitive there are ear plugs provided for sleeping).  I was also expecting a hot and stuffy space, being in a loft in the middle of summer, but the AC was strong and the space is just so open and comfortable.  The kitchenette is perfect for whipping up a little food, but it is not a kitchen to prepare a big meal in.  Luckily the food recommendations from Brian and Hillary are great (hit up the Valley for sandwiches). The place is also incredibly convenient, a block away from the free train into downtown Tacoma.  Brian and Hillary were also very accommodating and on top of their communication (I quickly received a response to all my questions). Check-in is a breeze and the star lights were a wonderful welcome.  The other wonderful aspect is their awesome art.  I would definitely stay here again.",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"This artists loft is a very special place! Loads of natural light fills the room during the day and enchanting fairy lights are strung for your enjoyment at night. A fantastic spot to relax during your time in Tacoma. The hosts utilize the space as a working studio as well, so there are areas you musn't touch but this really isn't a problem given the comfy areas provided for their guests. The 2 beds (in opposite corners of the large room) are outfitted with fresh, cozy linens and both provide a private space around them. The loft is conveniently located near freeway access as well as walking distance to incredible restaurants, parks and other prime Tacoma attractions.  We were very comfortable during our 10 night stay and hope to visit again! ",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"Loft was perfect option for visiting out Tacoma friend. There were two separate sleeping spaces at opposite end of huge loft. I slept on the sectional which was super comfy especially with the high end linens provided. One bathroom with a nice shower with all products provided. Two blow dryers, straight iron and a separate mirror just outside bathroom. Easy walk to glass museum/bridge. Alfred’s restaurant across the street was an easy option for breakfast. A little noisy during am week days but didn’t really bother us and we used the projector to watch Netflix. Will definitely stay here again.",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"Brian and Hillary's place is a great place stay if you're visiting the Tacoma area.  Pictures accurately show the loft, and you won't be disappointed with the space.  I almost didn't want to leave during my stay...just was so comfortable.  They leave a detailed guide of local spots to check out along with estimated walking/driving times-- Alfred's Cafe across the street is a great spot for breakfast (get the Biscuits and gravy--chorizo gravy FTW).   This will be one of the first AirBnB I will check when I head back to Tacoma.",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"The hosts are kind and attentive. They were flexible with our need for an early arrival time and offered all sorts of tips for navigating the area.   The space has divine natural light, is appointed perfectly, and has lovely energy throughout. Sweet little notes are placed throughout the apartment, surprising you and making you smile as you settle into the space. Their attention to detail is exceptional. Anything you need, they'll have a resource.   I'm already trying to figure out a reason to come back to Tacoma soon, just so I can spend more time there!",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"This place was AWESOME. Sparkling clean, full of thoughtful touches (fresh flowers, ear plugs by the bed, cute notes explaining details around the house, sketch spaces, etc.), and right by the light rail, bus and train stations. We loved staying here during a work conference! The pillows were as comfortable as any hotel I’ve stayed at, and the beds and sofa were great too. I hope to stay here again someday!  PLUS, Brian and Hillary were super responsive from check-in to check-out, and gave us great recommendations. They couldn’t have been better hosts. :)",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"This is one of the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. For me it's all about the vibe, the amenities, and the location. This place gets bonus points for the vibe. My colleague and I were in town to do a project that required a lot of creative thinking, so this space was just the fertile ground we needed. Brian and Hillary were uber-responsive and the place had everything we needed - including coffee, tea, cream, and even a few local brews.  The only thing I could wish for is a grocery option that is a bit closer. But don't let that stop you from booking this gem!",Tacoma,0
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"What a unique space! The 5 of us were comfortable and warm. The extras touches were so fantastic! Fresh flowers, paper and markers for doodling, games, cold drinking water, coffee & CREAM! We played records, hung out in the hammock, we loved taking advantage of all you had to offer.  We loved the decor and style of the loft!  As said in the description- it can be pretty noisy at night. City noises- trains, cars, people- but that is fully stated and there are ear plugs left for guests for that reason. So I expected it. Communication was EXCELLENT! The minor issues we had were quickly solved with a quick text.  If ever a need for a place in Tacoma again, we'll be booking here.",Tacoma,0
Comfortable room with private bath,"Stay at Barb's place!! The house is beautiful and comfortable with nice touches like coffee/breakfast in the morning and friendly pets. Barb goes above and beyond to make sure your needs are accommodated and you feel at home. The bedroom/bathroom were sparkling clean and had all the amenities you could ever imagine needing. The room is even cuter than the pictures, and the bed is super comfortable! As LGBTQ travelers, my partner and I felt very comfortable at Barb's place and enjoyed the neighborhood. We will definitely stay again if we find ourselves in Tacoma!",Tacoma,0
Comfortable room with private bath,"I usually rent an entire place on Airbnb, so this was only the 2nd time I rented a room. It seems like it could feel awkward, but Barb and Pat were extremely welcoming. Their home is lovely, and the room is clean, light, with plenty of room for 1 or 2 people. Their bedroom is across the hall, but I never saw them; they know how to provide privacy. The bathroom is just down the hall, & you don't have to share it. In the morning, I went downstairs for coffee, and we ended up having a great conversation for quite awhile! They also provided simple breakfast things, which was so kind of them! I went for a nice walk in the evening, through Wright Park and beyond. It's in a great location--on a very quiet street, but close to downtown. I would stay again in a heartbeat!",Tacoma,0
Comfortable room with private bath,Barb and Pat are people we all wish to cross paths with. They are so kind and interactive. It was a pleasure to witness how much love is in their home. They have two loving pups that were so sweet.   The room was as expected. Clean and there are great amenities. There were cookies waiting for us when we arrived and we were not shy about inhaling them. Pat was up in the morning with coffee which my husband enjoyed. They always took time to ask how we were doing. There was a private bathroom for guests with toiletries.   Check in was easy. Barb showed us around the home and there is a code for the lock which made it very simple.  Parking was right in front of the home and always for available.   The location is perfect if you want to stay out of Seattle. It is quiet and clean. There are plenty of places to eat.   Thank you Barb and Pat. We appreciate the little details and thank you for always willing to help when I needed. ,Tacoma,0
Comfortable room with private bath,"I had a great stay at Pat & Barb’s place. It was well located and easy to get around with shops and restaurants nearby. The room is a good size, comfortable bed, nice cross breeze with the window open and very relaxing after a full day out house hunting. When I arrived Pat greeted me and gave me the tour and to my surprise there were fresh baked chocolate chip cookies waiting for me in the room. I have a sweet tooth, this is how you win me over! The bathroom was great, very roomy (great for tall folks especially) and private. I can’t recommend this place enough, attention to detail throughout. When in Tacoma, stay here! ",Tacoma,0
Beautiful North End Studio in Wooded Setting,This was my second stay at Susan and Roy's space and it met and surpasses expectations again. The extra touches of the quality sheets (so warm) and attention to detail with the bathroom towels and food for the morning are just stellar. Susan called me day of to see if I wanted an early check-in and also to confirm my muffin choice.  The communication and welcoming environment is just wonderful.   I will always be checking here first for availability when I am back in the area. Highly recommend!!,Tacoma,0
Beautiful North End Studio in Wooded Setting,"This little studio is beautifully decorated, very clean, many thoughtful touches, at a professional level  B and B!  The picture doesn’t do it justice! I enjoyed being greeted by Susan, and then allowed privacy, with a separate entrance and parking spot. The bed is so comfortable I didn’t want to leave, coffee and breakfast options  in the little  kitchen were very welcome, and the lovely neighborhood setting filled with trees was really nice. It was easy and enjoyable to spend the weekend in Tacoma in this lovely place.",Tacoma,0
Beautiful North End Studio in Wooded Setting,"This was my first time at Susan & Roy's place. I just loved it!! I regularly come to Tacoma to visit my daughter at college. This is now on my ""favorite's"" list. Susan greeted me and showed me around. She really made me feel welcome. They put so much thought into the decor and comfort for their guests.  I love the serenity inside and that you can enjoy the pretty backyard. We had a very rainy and cold day while I was visiting. My daughter and I got food. She came over and we had a very cozy afternoon of studying and reading. I highly recommend this place!",Tacoma,0
Beautiful North End Studio in Wooded Setting,"Roy and Susan are great hosts and their space is very comfortable.  there is great detail paid to the extra special touches like soft sheets, comfy bed and plush towels.  The home was easy to find and the private entrance and parking space was wonderful.  I was visiting the Tacoma/Seattle area as a solo vacation trip and they were super helpful and responsive in terms of ideas of local attractions and what I should make time to see and any questions I had in general.  This was my first airbnb experience and I would absolutely visit their home again if I am back in Tacoma.",Tacoma,0
Beautiful North End Studio in Wooded Setting,"Beautiful home with many amenities! The back yard is incredible: well groomed and taken care of. Definitely a positive asset of this home. The studio is perfect for two people to live comfortably. It has modern features and great interior design. If staying in the Tacoma area,  Susan and Roy’s place is by far the best option. My expectations were exceeded by Susan’s thoughtful touches. She provided breakfast and even a first aid kit! What really solidified my confidence in staying in this home was Susan’s hospitality. She was so welcoming and made our brief stay so wonderful. Another plus, was the proximity to activities and restaurants! Thank you for having us! ",Tacoma,0
Beautiful North End Studio in Wooded Setting,"Beautiful little gem.  Quiet, very private, serene.  Looks exactly as pictured, lovely and warm. Susan and Roy greeted me on arrival, even though it was past stated check-in time, to show us the studio, where everything could be found, and invited me to enjoy their lovely garden (with koi pond) at any time during my stay. The location was perfect for me, short drive to visit my daughter at college, and the very quiet and peaceful neighborhood was great for a morning walk.  Short drive to Old Town and pretty much anywhere else in Tacoma you want to go, without any traffic noise.  Really nice stay, would definitely stay again!",Tacoma,0
Great Room for Solo Traveler,"The place was excellent with well thought out features throughout the house. These include the signage throughout the place, the ability to have a place for dirty towels, the quality sheets, the fabulous decor, shampoo and soap for showers, the walking distance location, secure access to the building, ability to lock the room, news quietly on in the morning in the main area, cool multi-plug device next to bed for cell phones and more, continental breakfast, and I could go...  Overall I thought the place was terrific and would enthusiastically recommend it to others.",Tacoma,0
Great Room for Solo Traveler,"Awesome accommodations if you're in need of a single room! The price seemed too good to be true, and it still does! Jimmy was fantastic from start-to-finish—a host who obviously understands his business—and the room was exactly as promised. I wasn't there long, so I can't speak to much in the way of amenities, but that's actually what was cool for me. It was easy-in and easy-out with everything I could have possibly needed to make my overnight stay pleasant and refreshing. I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in town.",Tacoma,0
Great Room for Solo Traveler,"Jimmy is a kind and accommodating host.  His home and rooms are clean and well equipped.  He also has a sweet dog that is extremely well behaved and let me love on him several times. I was attending an event at the nearby Hotel Murano and this was in close enough location to get there in 5 minutes driving.  Next time I’ll use UBER to avoid $16 per day hotel parking or walk there if it’s daylight.  The home is in an area that is urban/downtown and may not be for everyone. That being said, as a single female traveler my room/ House was very comfortable and felt secure.  This room has a common wall with the bathroom and a road with moderate traffic outside the bedroom window.  The room is equipped with a nice sound machine and earplugs if you’re a light sleeper. While in town I also went to the Olympus women’s spa located 15 minutes away and Southern Kitchen which is down the street. A great last minute option.",Tacoma,0
Great Room for Solo Traveler,"This is the ideal place to rest your head for one or two nights in Tacoma, WA. Jimmy is a helpful and welcoming host. Everything listed in the posting is included in your stay, although I would further recommend asking Jimmy about his other businesses and view on the geopolitical landscape for an eye-opening chat. Guests are guaranteed privacy, cleanliness and expedient service at this location. The host, Jimmy, even helped me return the keys that I left on the front porch of his home and also volunteered to host my bicycle at no extra charge. I would absolutely recommend this spot to any traveler passing-through Washington State. There is no doubt that I will return to this Airbnb if I ever find myself passing-through Tacoma again.",Tacoma,0
Nice cozy room across from park,"I had a wonderful experience at Jimmy's place. For one, the place was easy to find especially with Christmas lights already up. Streetside parking was available too. The house atmosphere was down-home comfortable with continental breakfast & chocolates in common areas and had touches of 'posh' with the New Yorker & Bon Appetit on hand along with other amenities. I enjoyed the themed Beach Room with comfy bed linens and a view of Mt. Ranier ( in the distance). He valued privacy, but was on hand for conversation too. There was easy access to downtown, area college campuses & hospitals.  I definitely would stay again!",Tacoma,0
Nice cozy room across from park,"Danny runs a great place and is clearly an experienced host who has learned the needs and wants of his guests. The bedroom is comfortable and has nice touches like a floor fan to keep you cool and a phone charging station on the  nightstand. The living room is a cool place to relax over breakfast or to read a book in the afternoon. We met some nice people there and enjoyed our conversation. He also stocks the kitchen with some breakfast items like breads, English muffins, pastries and cereals, not to mention plenty of coffee.   I loved the personalized welcome and quick responses whenever we had a question, as well. I’d highly recommend this for folks who enjoy meeting other guests and who appreciate a centralized location inside the city.",Tacoma,0
N. Tacoma/UPS Hideaway,"We enjoyed our stay at Stephanie's apartment.  The location was perfect for us as we come to Tacoma to visit family in the Proctor area, a short drive away.  Stephanie is a lovely host.  She introduced herself to us when we checked in and was very available and responsive during our stay whenever we had questions.  The full kitchen, comfy bed, off-street parking space, private laundry facilities and quiet neighborhood were all important plusses for us.  We would highly recommend Stephanie's place to anyone visiting Tacoma.",Tacoma,0
N. Tacoma/UPS Hideaway,"I stayed at Stephanie's place for about 3 months, so if anyone was going to find something bad about this place, it would have been me. But I never did! If you are coming to Tacoma, you won't regret staying with Stephanie! She is such a sweetheart and put so many cute details into her place. The bed is very comfy and will be a great asset to you when you are done with all of your activities in Tacoma, especially since this is centrally located.  I worked at the hospital and it is only a few blocks walk. The parking spot is also a big plus.",Tacoma,0
N. Tacoma/UPS Hideaway,"A cozy, clean and comfortable spot in the historic North End! No detail is overlooked in Stephanie's unfussy, light-filled basement apartment: fully equipped kitchen with all the necessities, bathroom stocked with toiletries,  parking spot right out front, washer and dryer, etc. We only stayed two nights while visiting family in the neighborhood but can imagine this would be the perfect place for longer stays in Tacoma. Quick drive to 6th Ave, Point Defiance, Proctor and Stadium districts, UPS, downtown etc.  Added bonus: within walking distance to the legendary Frisko Freeze!",Tacoma,0
N. Tacoma/UPS Hideaway,"Really chic and cozy space! Decor is modern and calming. Nice coffee service! The refrigerator has eggs, English muffins, butter and jam. The bed is super comfy and the sofa bed is also comfy! The space can fit up to 4 people! My daughter and I really felt at home. Very easy check-in and Stephanie is super responsive and helpful. She is very thoughtful and her space contains a lot of nice touches. Would love to come back when my daughter goes to university. Definitely walking distance to UPS and only 1.5 mile or a 20 minute walk to the bay. Gorgeous stay.",Tacoma,0
N. Tacoma/UPS Hideaway,"Stephane’s place is an adorable, very well decorated & clean basement suite in a very nice part of Tacoma, equip with all you need including A/C! As first time visitors to Tacoma it was the perfect place for a girls weekend! We felt very safe. The Queen bed is extremely comfortable! The parking was perfect! Stephanie answered all our questions quickly & was a fantastic host! I would recommend you stay here! I have one tip: the corner store a few blocks away is very expensive. I would suggest you pick things you might need for your stay at a grocery store you arrive.",Tacoma,0
The Loft,"Stayed at this place to surprise my boyfriend for our anniversary and he was blown away by how gorgeous and spacious the loft was! The theme and decor are very stylish and Gloria keeps everything clean and tidy, and the house rules are straight to the point. The loft is located in a great spot because events, activities, and restaurants in Tacoma are a short walk or short drive/Lyft away. Gloria is also a very friendly and helpful host who communicates and responds quickly. It definitely felt like a home away from home! Absolutely loved our stay and recommend it to anyone for a nice, intimate getaway in Tacoma :)",Tacoma,0
The Loft,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Gloria's stylish loft.  Her loft is in a great central location in downtown Tacoma within walking distance of theatres, museums, UW-Tacoma, restaurants, etc. .  Gloria was very responsive, responding to our messages within seconds, and offering very clear instructions for entry and leaving.  The loft is very stylish, very clean, and comfortable with great amenities [e.g., internet, washer/dryer, French press and coffee, snacks, eggs, etc.].  Perfect launching pad for exploring the best Tacoma has to offer.",Tacoma,0
The Loft,"Gloria was fantastic! 10/10! Great communicator w/ quick response time. Met us at the door with a prepaid parking sticker :) There was a key missing from a previous guest and she stuck around to meet the locksmith! We were very appreciative of all of the above and more: little snacks, comfy bed, cute (and clean) space and close to fun restaurants. Added bonus was the $12 uber (cheap!) to the Tacoma Dome for our concert. My aunt and I had a really great time! Wish we could have explored the antique shops. Would rent again for another Tacoma Dome night!",Tacoma,0
The Loft,"The Loft is perfectly located in the theater area of town, in easy walking distance to a number of interesting breweries and restaurants. We enjoyed the Odd Otter brew pub and the donut place about five doors down.   The place was well stocked. We could have had fresh brewed coffee with creamer in the home and taken advantage of the provided snacks, but we decided to wander in the morning. The bed was comfortable and there were lots of pillows. It wasn’t clear to me from the write up, but there is a stacked washer and dryer in the home.   Gloria was an awesome host. She allowed us to keep our luggage in the space until we headed to the airport and indicated that if she ended up needing the place earlier, she’d store it at her home for us. I absolutely recommend Gloria’s place!",Tacoma,0
The Loft,"I absolutely loved The Loft. I have to say it is one of my favorite places I have stayed. It was spotless, cozy, and beautiful. The next time I stay in Tacoma, I will definitely be staying there. The only thing I can complain about is not having enough time to enjoy this space to the fullest, since I was in town for a work event and had to leave at 7 the next morning.  I booked last minute, and Gloria was very quick to respond and thorough with all instructions. It was so easy to communicate with her!  Thank you Gloria!",Tacoma,0
The Loft,"Growing up in Seattle we laughed at Tacoma and while it's true that the ""aroma of Tacoma"" still wafts about in the sea air the city itself has been quietly reinventing itself for the better part of a decade.  Having NOT torn down its old buildings, the visitor is now treated to a thriving creative laboratory housed in weird cool surroundings.  It's still funky in a methadone-clinic sort of way but clearly on the upswing and I can't wait to get back.  This location is fantastic for exploring -- Vintage Row right around the corner, easy access to whatever might have brought you to Tacoma.  And the loft itself surpasses expectation with a large open floor plan and great furnishing.",Tacoma,0
The Loft,"Wow, if you are looking for an oasis in the middle of fast paced downtown Tacoma- THIS is the place for you! Gloria's place is beautiful, so spacious and has everything you could ever  really want in a home away from home. Gloria is also very responsive and makes sure you have everything you need which is so nice. At the end of a long day, grabbing a drink at one of the endless options of restaurants and bars in the area, relaxing in the huge jetted tub and then curling up in the sleep number bed is exactly what I needed. I would stay at this place again in a heartbeat and if you're staying in town, I absolutely recommend you do too!!",Tacoma,0
The Loft,This space was well above our expectations. My husband and I came here right from our wedding reception. We were exhausted from a very long day and Gloria’s loft was the perfect oasis for us to unwind. First of all my phone got stolen that night which was the phone I booked our trip on and Gloria was extremely helpful and understanding as we had to change phones on which we were communicating.  Once we walked in to the loft our mouths dropped. The walk up can easily deter you but oh man once you walk in- your transported to another place. It is a perfectly decorated balance between stylish and homey. Everything was spotless and everything you need is provided. I would reccomend this loft to anyone staying in Tacoma. Absoslutely worth it. Thank you is not enough Gloria!,Tacoma,0
The Loft,"I have been traveling to Tacoma frequently for work and during a recent trip I stayed at Gloria's loft--it was without doubt my most pleasurable stay in Tacoma so far. The property is in the Theater District and there are a decent number of places close by for dinner/lunch/drinks. The place itself is beautiful--spacious, stylish, comfortable, with a lot of attention to detail and very very clean. Gloria is a great host and replies back to any questions immediately. I definitely plan to be back here.",Tacoma,0
Quiet Retreat at Casa Esmeralda 2,"The house was very homey, clean and comfortable. Esme was super friendly and helpful with information about the area.  She laid out a wonderful spread of breakfast goodies each morning, which was so nice.  We had the upstairs room  and while it said a shared bathroom I think we were the only ones using it.  The back deck is really awesome to sit on in the morning with a cup of coffee or enjoy the cool evenings. No air conditioning (most homes in the area don’t have it) so we slept with the windows open each night and that was nice. They did provide a fan but we only used it on the first warm night.  The location was perfect for us to visit our daughter only a couple miles away.  Great parking, too, with lots of room in the driveway and seems like a very safe area.  We highly recommend this Airbnb.",Tacoma,0
Quiet Retreat at Casa Esmeralda 2,"This was the perfect place for us to stay in while in town for a family reunion. Esmie and her husband are perfect hosts and made us feel comfortable in their home. Although there were several other rented rooms downstairs, the house was quiet and our space felt private.   Every morning we were greeted with a breakfast spread of coffee (Keurig), bagels, cereal, pastries, hard boiled eggs, cream cheese, and yogurt. They had cow’s milk and almond milk.   The bed was very comfortable, and the closet had room for our luggage. The private bathroom was across the hall, but posed no problems.   We checked in with a lockbox, but given our own key. It was not a problem to come and go as we pleased.   We would definitely stay here again and look forward to doing so.",Tacoma,0
Quiet Retreat at Casa Esmeralda 2,"Esmie's place (Casa 2 we stayed in) was a dream come true Airbnb! As an Airbnb host myself, I recommend her place 100% --it was the best experience I have ever had traveling. And the location was perfect--in a safe, quiet neighborhood with easy parking, but close enough to food/shopping. Details: The bed was like a marsh mellow cloud from heaven, and I fell asleep so quickly I actually thought I was at home when I woke up! The whole room is beautifully decorated in a balanced, peaceful way (there is an actual theme, versus random), that obviously was thoughtfully put together. I loved the vanity in the room so I could do my makeup, and the little ring/jewelry holder beside the bed. Super cute, useful, and thoughtful things like this are everywhere you turn, including in the bathroom (which had everything we needed). The breakfast my husband and I had was excellent (eggs, toast, cereal, fruit, cereal, etc), and we were allowed to eat on the deck (which was incredibly lovely). Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest. She knew exactly how to interact with us when we were tired upon arrival (politely gave us space after showing us in), and chatted with us more in the morning when we had lots of energy and wanted to talk. This is the most wonderful Airbnb experience we have ever had and will totally stay in the future! ",Tacoma,0
Quiet Retreat at Casa Esmeralda 2,"Esmie really makes you feel at home. She is a talented host and her home is clean, comfortable and very nicely decorated. She has everything ready in the morning for her guests to help themselves to a complete continental-style breakfast. You might have an opportunity to meet another guest in the morning and share a bit of conversation with your morning coffee or tea - it was a very easy and comfortable stay. She has an extra refrigerator in the lower level for guests as well. The private bathroom, directly across the  hall from the bedroom, was very clean and convenient and included towels, soap and shampoo. The bedroom was warm and cozy and the desk was convenient for setting up a computer. The off-street parking made it easy to get your bag into the house. The neighborhood is quiet but also close to shopping.  A 20 min. drive down Bridgeport to Ruston (depending on the time of day)  and you are at the Vashon ferry. Highly recommended!",Tacoma,0
Comfortable room with twin beds and private bath,I had to cancel my stay at Jo’s place because of the weather. But Airbnb is still asking me to write a review and so I’m going to review based on my communication with Jo even though I didn’t get to actually stay. Jo was very responsive to messages and was very understanding that I had an emergency and couldn’t make it to Tacoma as the road conditions were very icy and dangerous and the event I planned to go to at the T-Dome had been cancelled due to weather. I really appreciate her understanding and will definitely try to book her place if I ever need to stay in Tacoma again. Thank you.,Tacoma,0
Comfortable room with twin beds and private bath,"Jo made every accommodation we had asked for and then some. She was responsive to initial inquiries about the space and replied within a short time to all communication. We are unsure of Tacoma. Jo showed us all the best spots including running along the waterfront and through beautiful and safe areas of the city. She gave us all the good tips of the local bar, Vietnamese restaurant and coffee shops. She provided very clean and welcoming atmosphere. She even had coffee ready to be made in the morning and breakfast.  Jo how does get on our way when it was time to go I was able to make suggestions. I’m very thankful for her.",Tacoma,0
Comfortable room with twin beds and private bath,"Jo is a gracious, friendly lady who has traveled extensively and her home shows this. Her art collection is fabulous! She makes you feel part of the family immediately! Her home is sparkling clean and the beds are to die for especially when you are tired!!! :) The rooms are light, bright, and spacious. The only drawback for me was the stairs up to our room. Otherwise, things could not have been more perfect. I  would ecourage anyone to stay there and I plan to use Jo's again when visiting Seattle!!",Tacoma,0
Comfortable room with twin beds and private bath,"This was a really wonderful spot. Jo was a fabulous host. Access to the house via her garage was offered, though street parking is also very easy. The room and bath were comfortable and tastefully decorated. She even baked granola in the morning for our breakfast!. She was a terrific resource for local eateries and things to do, and knowing our interest in glass art, she procured a pass to the Museum of Glass in Tacoma! A first rate host in a great neighborhood. We plan to stay here again during our next trip to Tacoma!. Thank you, Jo.",Tacoma,0
Comfortable room with twin beds and private bath,"Jo's place is centrally located in Tacoma. Close to everything! Stores, museums, exhibits, pubs, local colleges, shops, restaurants, bus line and not one but two hospitals. There's even a park just a few steps away. Although Jo's house is closeby to all of the above mentioned, it was surprisingly quiet at night and I got a well rested sleep.  Accommodating host, easy to communicate with and lovely to just converse with. Jo provides all the amenities one could possibly need and the house is superbly clean. Highly recommended place to stay in if ever visiting Tacoma.",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"You can count on Zeena to make your stay wonderful. Her home is immaculately clean, the room is spotless, and the linens and towels are sanitized before each guest. You are greeted and welcomed by Zeena into her home as if you are family and she takes care of your needs as such, maybe even better. Breakfast was wonderful and there are several options. The dining space is beautiful and the conversation is very nice. It is easy to come and go and she respects your privacy if that is your wish.   I really loved it here. 5/5 would stay again.",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"We were in town for a wedding in Olalla, and chose to stay in the cute town of Gig Harbor. Zeena was incredibly sweet, the house is cute, and breakfast was amazing! We all around enjoyed our stay; bed was cozy, private bathroom, but please be aware this is definitely a private room (and she does such a great job of making you feel comfortable) but it’s across the hall from her bedroom so it has the feel as though you are staying in somebody else’s house therefore it might be weird to hang out with friends or anywhere but the bedroom, depending on your comfortability.",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"My husband and I were thrilled that we decided to stay in Gig Harbor for our anniversary weekend. Though the Michael Buble concert at the Tacoma Dome was our ultimate goal, our stay with Zeena and Howard was equally as fabulous. We felt pampered from start to finish. The location felt like a secret hideaway, with Zeena's designer touches making it feel warm and inviting. Having breakfast served both days was so very special.  Her dining suggestions in GH were spot on for what we wanted. Our conversations were pleasantly enjoyable, and we loved our room! You will, too.",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"Our time at Zeena's was an experience that we weren't expecting, but are so blessed to have had. Zeena is one of the sweetest human beings I have ever met. It is very apparent that it is important to her that her guests feel welcome, cared for, and truly at ""home away from home"". And we felt just that. The room was clean, with just enough space for us to be comfortable, and was outfitted with snacks and magazines with info on the area. The home is decorated so meticulously and thoughtfully. Zeena made us breakfast each morning, along with coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. Everything was delicious. Zeena has a servants heart and radiated love from the minute we met her. If you are wondering whether or not to book your stay here, stop and just do it. You will be glad that you did!",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"This is heaven. Zeena's house is the most beautifully-decorated house I've ever seen.  She is an excellent host, cook and interior designer. The breakfast alone worths the money.  Everything in breakfast is organic. Beddings are 100% cotton. Hair and body care products are all great brands. And sparkling clean is not an enough word to describe the bedroom and bathroom.  Zeena even provides the earplugs and eye pads for light sleepers. Thank you Airbnb for introducing this wonderful experience into my life and I'm becoming a big fan and advocate of Airbnb because of this stay. I will keep using Airbnb when travel but I think Zeena's five+ star hospitality has set an extremely high bar for my future stay :)",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"It was so wonderful to have a chance to stay with Zeena again... and a great way to introduce my husband to Airbnb! Zeena is an amazing and thoughtful host. The accommodations are inviting and warm from the moment you enter her home. The private room is quiet and has a very comfortable bed! Ensuite bath with lovely amenities provided. Loved the new addition of snacks and water in the room!  And then there is her homemade breakfast.... SO delicious!  Hope we have another trip in the future, we'll definitely stay again!",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it was simply amazing  - Zeena is a fantastic host who cares for her guests in the best possible way. We had a good room to sleep and it was a pleasure to wake up to the chirping of birds, something perfect to start your day. The breakfast was the best breakfast I ever had on the road, ever since I came to USA 2 years back. The home interiors are very artistic, well maintained and super clean and the location is perfect from all the crowd and hustles of city life. Zeena also gave us trip details regarding attractions in the area and it was a pleasure we took that into considerations. The stay was awesome and I would certainly prefer to go back there again!",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"Zeena truly is the hostess with the mostest! A delightful, positive person with lots of great energy! I booked this for my Dad's visit as we are currently without a guest room. I wanted a home away from home for him and that's exactly what he received! Zeena and Howard go out of their way to make their guests feel like part of the family. My Dad enjoyed the tasty and healthy breakfasts. He liked being able to watch TV in the sitting room just outside of his bedroom. He kept raving about how clean Zeena keeps their home!  At the end of the week, we hugged our hostess and thanked her for my Dad's wonderful stay!",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"Puts the ""bed and breakfast"" into AirBNB.  Other AirBNB places I've rented are more like alternative motel lodging, but this is what I imagine what a traditional bed and breakfast must be like.  Not only do you get a cozy, comfortable room to stay in, you receive a private tea party at breakfast, and friendly company -- it's more like staying with a long lost aunt than staying at a hotel.  In addition, Zeena was very accommodating about my special request to check in very late due to attending a late night music event.  There is a band named ""Charming Hostess"" that is related to the music I heard -- they were not present that night, but their title was instead ably filled by Zeena.",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"Zeena is the hostess with the mostest!    She is very attentive to details, and offers a gourmet breakfast every morning.   I have dietary allergies, and Zeena made sure to tailor breakfast with my allergies in mind - she is a very kind person and a generous hostess.   Zeena is very knowledgeable about  local activities and has great suggestions if you want to do some site seeing.   The room is well appointed and spacious, with lots of spare clean towels.   When I stay with Zeena, I am in the lap of luxury!",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"The house is in a perfect quiet location very close to Gig Harbor.  There’s big trees and it’s very tranquil.  The room is comfortable, and nicely decorated.  The bed is comfortable, and you won’t want to get up.  There’s snacks, shampoo, lotions, and other nice touches.  The bathroom was very clean, and the shower nice.  Breakfast was delicious, and thoughtfully prepared.  Zeena, and her husband are very kind people, and you will feel welcome.  I would have liked to stay for a week.  The house is easy to find right off the main road, but print the driving directions out, as well as the address.  Plenty of parking on a large cul de sac with no traffic.",Tacoma,0
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"Words can’t describe how amazing this Airbnb is!! The host is welcoming and kind, has great recommendations for the town as well as amazing stories that will have you lost in conversation. The room is gorgeous, spotless, and the bed is so comfortable. To top it off - breakfast! The homemade meal with fresh squeezed orange juice and tasty coffee was the best way to start a morning. She is the best Airbnb I’ve ever experienced, and I’ll definitely be returning to see both her and the lovely Samantha (sweetest dog ever).",Tacoma,0
Downtown Modern Townhouse with a View! Sleeps 6,"Jeni’s place was the perfect home for our stay in Tacoma. Walking distance to some fun breweries & restaurants, but also a quick car ride, Uber, or scooter ride from others.  Jeni was easy to get ahold of & had tons of suggestions available for things to do in the area. We had great weather during our visit & loved looking out from the back deck each morning to see Mt. Ranier.    While attached to another house, we never heard the neighbors or had any issues. The house is pretty close to some nearby homeless shelters & streets filled with tents,  but this is a common occurrence all over the Seattle/Tacoma area & we never once felt unsafe.   The 2 bedrooms were nicely sized & the master had huge closets. It’s always nice to have linens & towels provided as well! We enjoyed having separate bathrooms for the 4 of us (2 couples) and the half bathroom downstairs as well. The option for a bed using the pullout sofa in the living area was also great. I would definitely stay here on any future visits & would recommend it for couples, families, or groups of friends!",Tacoma,0
Downtown Modern Townhouse with a View! Sleeps 6,"Situated close to popular attractions such as the Museum of Glass, this home was thoughtfully furnished and clean. If you happened to forget something before arriving, the house likely has a clean spare of what you need (toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc). In addition, there were some communal food items available, which helped since I forgot to bring granola bars for breakfast; a quick PB&J did the trick before walking the town! The home is within walking distance to several excellent breweries, just note that there is quite an incline to the streets from the home down to the shops/museums/harbor. One thing to point out is that if you’re not used to road noise, the home is on a 4-lane 30mph road; thankfully, the host had already provided ear plugs for those that aren’t used to it.",Tacoma,0
Downtown Modern Townhouse with a View! Sleeps 6,"The place: This Airbnb is fantastic. It was equipped with the best amenities, the view from the kitchen showed a good view of Downtown Tacoma.  We were not left short for anything.  The location: This is a perfect example of a place that is really close to bustling downtown area without being right in the middle of the chaos. A lot of wonderful places were within walking distance/a minute's drive, but the street itself is not too busy. It was perfect. We explored Downtown Tacoma, Anthem coffee shop, 7 seas brewery, Valhalla coffee and a number of places.   The host: Jeni is amazing. I did not have to interact with her a whole lot because the directions and labels in the house are so spot on and intuitive. Jeni also left a few breakfast supplies in the refrigerator, which was really nice on a busy work day. I'd have to look for her properties every time I'm here.",Tacoma,0
Downtown Modern Townhouse with a View! Sleeps 6,"Jeni's house is very spacious; two decent sized bedrooms and full baths, great full kitchen (I made Thanksgiving dinner for our family here!), good sized living area.  Very clean.  I didn't expect the extras she provided such as full breakfast, robes, slippers  We actually spent a good amount of time here.  Location is very good and safe area.  I am a runner and ran a couple of mornings north on Yakima for a 5 mile run.  Very close to Pacific Ave. shops; a 1/2 mile walk downhill.  My husband is quite picky and not prone to compliment and he actually told me that this location was a great fit for us!  I am recommending to friends that also have relatives in the Tacoma area.  We will definitely book again the next time we are in the area.",Tacoma,0
Downtown Modern Townhouse with a View! Sleeps 6,"Jeni’s condo was a true oasis! We had been traveling at Mt. Rainer National Park and were ready to feel at home. Jeni’s place was exactly that - a home away from home. Everything that we had been missing about home (some space to move around, a real kitchen, an amazing bathtub) was found at this terrific Airbnb. The view from the back bedroom was priceless - Mount Rainer in all its glory and sparkling city lights overlooking the Sound... This was truly an exceptional Airbnb experience, and one we hope to return to any time we are in the Seattle / Tacoma area.",Tacoma,0
Downtown Modern Townhouse with a View! Sleeps 6,"Jeni's Airbnb is one to not skip out on! If you love the feel of a modern brand new place, this is the spot that you would enjoy. It has 2 bed rooms and 3 1/2 baths with a kitchen that I wish I had in my house. It also has a balcony that shows a view of all of Tacoma. On some days we can see Mt. Rainier from a far and that is a sight for sore eyes!  Jeni was a wonderful host that stopped by from time to time mainly just to restock and made sure trash was taken out properly for the weekly city trash runs. She was very polite and communicative to when contractors would come or when we needed tips for visiting areas around where we would stay. She's probably the most genuine airbnb host I've ever had thus far! Love the stay, will definitely come back again if I'm in Seattle area!",Tacoma,0
VIEW Cottage 3beds/2bath - sleeps 8,"This lovely home was the most peaceful, scenic getaway for me and my friends on a ladies weekend. The views of the bay, the snow capped mountains, and the city off in the distance made for such relaxing mornings! We loved the location away from the hustle and bustle of Tacoma, but still close enough to go into town for the day. The house itself is immaculate, welcoming, stylish and roomy enough for the 6 of us to be more than comfortable. The hosts were very quick to reply when we needed help getting the access code to unlock the door. I would absolutely stay here again if we ever went back to Tacoma.",Tacoma,0
VIEW Cottage 3beds/2bath - sleeps 8,"Wonderful place to stay! Very nice house with a beautiful view. After spending the 4 nights before in an apartment, a tent and a hotel... it was great to spread out here and relax! Great location with easy distance to tons of restaurants & activities. Very clean space and comfortable bed. We had a hiccup during our stay with the power going out in the WHOLE town (freak incident)! Host Jerry was so awesome with communication during this time and even came by to check on us and make sure we didn't need anything else. We played board games by flashlight/candle until the power was restored - it was great to have that extra non-electric entertainment while we were there. Overall great stay and highly recommend!!",Tacoma,0
VIEW Cottage 3beds/2bath - sleeps 8,"Jerry & Julie have created a masterpiece with this home. First, its location is in a quiet and scenic neighborhood, and the views of the Sound will immediately draw you to the back patios for relaxation.  The layout and design of the house is tailor-made for guests with families, or couples looking for a quiet retreat. The bedrooms have plenty of room, the bathrooms are spacious and the living room is cozy with a warm fireplace. The kitchen is a winner too. We love preparing and cooking our own meals while on vacation instead of dining out, so having a kitchen that’s spacious and fully equipped is a must for our family.  Lastly the rental homes that stand out the most to us are the ones where we can tell the hosts genuinely care about every detail and making sure at every step that guests are cared for. Jerry & Julie made our late (midnight) check in a breeze and were always available if we ever needed anything. But we didn’t ever have to bother them because all of the exceptional communication for checkin, checkout and how to navigate the home. Amenities were all provided in organized written form. There’s even have an extensive personalized guide they have created for guests with their recommendations for activities, restaurants and sights, which we used to visit nearly Dash Point state park for a fun 3-mile family day hike.  We highly recommend this home for your stay in the area and will definitely be back one day!",Tacoma,0

The space is immaculate and feels as if you are at a home away from home. From the plush towels to the incredibly comfy beds, you will immediately feel welcome. The views are breathtaking.

Proctor Cottage w/Queen Bed and Private Parking,"This is an absolute gem that we lucked into during our stay in Tacoma!  Michelle is an amazing host - quick response times, wonderful insights about the area, and just a warm ,funny, and friendly person.  We loved getting to chat with her.  The cottage was sparkling clean, beautifully decorated, and stocked with any amenity one might need during their stay, be it toiletries, board games/DVDs, or pantry items to snack on!  There are lots of sweet helpful signs placed strategically around the space that add a warm, personal touch to the cottage.  An absolutely wonderful place to stay in Tacoma!

Proctor Cottage w/Queen Bed and Private Parking,"This is an amazing little place very close to the campus of the University of Puget Sound. The check-in process is a breeze and communication with the host is outstanding.  In fact, the day my husband and I were due to arrive I notified the host that my husband was unable to come and that I was bringing another swim mom with me instead. The host graciously set up another futon bed in the studio (which had to be brought out of storage.). The decor is lovely and all the extras provided were above and beyond any Airbnb I have stayed at.  I will definitely be coming back here.  Great value for the price. Highly recommend.",Tacoma,0
Proctor Cottage w/Queen Bed and Private Parking,"A Perfect Cottage, with everything you need. This space has everything you could think of that you might require for a few days away. There was good communication with Jeni when we were delayed five hours, The cottage was warm clean and welcoming.  Having robes in the closet and breakfast supplies for the morning was invaluable after arriving 5 hours later than planned.  The cottage was quiet, and there was plentiful information about how everything worked, and about restaurants and places to go in the neighborhood. Thank you Jeni and Michelle, we'll certainly have you at the top of our list when we're back in Tacoma again",Tacoma,0

I could go on and on. There was plenty of privacy, but the hosts were quick to welcome and were available if we needed anything at all. I wish I could give more than five stars.

Proctor Cottage w/Queen Bed and Private Parking,"This little cottage is a great find, and Michelle is an incredibly generous host. Cottage includes hair dryer, and pretty much anything you might forget to bring with you (extra toothbrush, toothpaste etc). There was a wide variety of breakfast food, and even some snack food. I stay in a lot of Airbnbs, and many do not provide these items. The cottage is NOT a basement apartment, either which is great. Private parking spot right next to the cottage and it has its own little patio outside, plus it's spacious. Really worth the stay.",Tacoma,0
Proctor Cottage w/Queen Bed and Private Parking,Proctor Cottage is an excellent value and I highly recommend it. It is well located with easy access to businesses and highways but still quiet and private. The little cottage is beautiful inside and out. The inside of the cottage is well appointed with all that you could want. The small living area is in the same space as the bed but there is plenty of room to enjoy the space. The host maintains a beautiful back yard (where the unit is located with direct access and parking from the alley) and was delightful and respectful. We are repeat visitors to Tacoma and will definitely try to book the Proctor Cottage again.,Tacoma,0

Walk out of the cottage in any direction and there are things to do and lovely residential neighborhoods to stroll.  City of Tacoma has loads of offer.

Private Cozy Cottage,"Heather's Cozy Cottage is wonderful!  First of all, she gives excellent directions, the exterior of the house is well lit (easy to find at night), and there is excellent off-street parking (we parked our full-size Nissan Titan without any difficulties!).  Additionally, she gave personal service, meeting us with the key, and walking use through the features of the home.  Secondly, the bed is very comfortable.  Both my husband and I have struggled with the quality of beds in AirBnb experiences in the past, but this Cottage is comfortable for us.  We are both side sleepers, if that helps at all. :)  While the space is definitely ""cozy,"" there is adequate space for a couple.  I loved having a full bath, allowing for soak after a day of driving/walking exploring the area.   The living room furniture is comfortable, both of us ended up dozing on the love seat during our stay.  WiFi coverage is good.  Overall, our experience was excellent, and we would gladly stay here again!",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"This apartment worked out splendidly for us - a couple with a two year old spending five days exploring Tacoma. Heather reached out shortly after we booked the space to ask if we needed anything special, and provided a Pack'N'Play crib for our toddler upon request. We got in after midnight, but she was happy to show us around, and even brought us fresh popcorn! The space is equipped with all the kitchen and bath supplies you would need, including a Keurig coffee maker and K-Cups, drinks in the fridge, a microwave, toaster over, etc. The hosts have also gone out of their way to provide local tourist information, some games and toys for children, and an assortment of DVDs. It is located in a low-key, friendly, suburbanish neighborhood. There is park with a brand new playground, with climbers, swings, and a zipline about two blocks away. Our son loved playing there. Grocery stores, restaurants, and coffee shops are also only a few blocks away. It is about a 10 minute drive to central Tacoma and 15 minutes to downtown. Terrific experience overall!",Tacoma,0

Private Cozy Cottage,"I recently stayed at the Private Cozy Cottage a 2nd time, from Jan 30th to Feb 6th. And I was not disappointed at all. Heather really knows how to take care of her guests. And this is a huge plus, the cottage is perfect situated in a quiet residential neighborhood as opposed to being on a busy street. And another plus, Heather's house is directly behind the cottage. Then interior of the cottage is spotlessly clean, and more than adequately supplied with all the amenities that you would need for your stay there. I would highly recommend the Private Cozy Cottage for your next stay in the area. Heather is a wonderful host!! I can totally see why she is considered a Superhost with Airbnb. As for me, I will always book my future stays at Heather's Private Cozy Cottage!! There is simply no other place I would consider staying at when in the area.",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"Heather’s “cozy”cottage was just that: cozy! We stayed in her cottage for 6 days in late-December. We selected Heather’s cottage because it was located just a block my son and his family.  Heather was the perfect host, and she provided us everything we needed to stay comfortable, dry (thank you for the extra umbrellas!), and happy! It’s located on a quiet street, and we had plenty of fresh towels, blankets, coffee — pretty much everything necessary — and more — to make our holiday visit perfect. Our bed was comfortable, and  the hide-a-bed my daughter slept on was also comfortable! A pleasant surprise, since most fold outs are mini torture devices! This is the perfect little AirBNB, and we will definitely be staying there again. We highly recommend Heather’s cottage!",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"My father and I were visiting my sister in University Place, Washington for 6 nights. My sister was actually the one who found the private cozy cottage for us.  I'd like to say it's one of the best places I ever stayed for AirBnb. Lets just say that Heather was awesome! She always kept in touch before our trip and made sure our flight was still on time from Washington DC. Once we arrived, she was there to greet us at the front door with a big smile on her face. She then provided us a tour of her place. During the tour she pointed out helpful maps that were framed and also local restaurant menus for us to look at if we wanted to order out. She also had board games for everyone to play and a very nice Keurig machine with K-cups available.   The private cozy cottage was more than I expected to be. First, it's a lot bigger than I expected. Second, the pull-out sofa bed was extra comfortable. Third, it was super clean and stylish. Forth, big flat screen TV and a DVD player was provided. Even the DVD Sleepless in Seattle was there too along with other movies. Also, refreshments in the fridge was provided for us which I thought was awesome. VIP parking spot was also available for your own personal vehicle or your rental. I call it VIP parking just because how close it was to the front door.   My father liked the fact that the cottage is located in a very safe and quiet residential neighborhood. Heather is very caring for others because she mentioned that she pays out of her own pocket to keep one of the street lights on at all times. She stated that even though she knew it was a safe neighborhood, she wanted to make sure her guests felt safe at all times.   Another thing I liked was everything was close by (2-3 mins away) such as grocery stores, Starbucks, other types of restaurants, and even Planet fitness. I almost forgot to mention that it was only 8 minutes away from my sister's home.  There was no type of traffic compared to the DC metropolitan area. Our commute to Seattle from the cottage was nice and smooth.   After staying there for 6 nights I highly recommend this location. My father was so satisfied that while staying there he booked another trip to stay at the cottage for 7 nights.  Once again, I wanted to thank Heather for everything and for making our trip memorable.   Greg Jr.",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"What a lovely experience staying at Heather's cottage. My brother and I were visiting Tacoma for a business trip. I don't have enough words to describe how wonderful Heather was. Amazing hospitality. She offered several times to take us to the grocery store and even to take us to a place where we were going to have dinner. Such an amazing lady!! <3 Cottage was warm, cozy, clean and comfortable. Neighborhood is safe. Great location!! Heather has it all! We will definitely come back to enjoy more day and with no doubt we will stay at Heather's cottage again. Highly recommended.",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"Heather's cozy cottage looks exactly like the pictures and the description.  It is an easy walk to stores, including grocery stores, and the bus line and is in a safe and clean neighborhood.  Bus #2 on 19th will take you directly to downtown Tacoma to visit museums and the Tacoma Dome.  Titlow Park is about a 15 minute walk and features bird-watching, playground and views of Tacoma Narrows.  Heather made sure we knew how to operate everything including the temperature and tv and had a great book of local eateries.",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"This cottage was so comfortable and truly cozy. We stayed with our 22-month-old son, and Heather had great accommodations for a young child. A full sized pack and play, a high chair, extra toys, a bathtub easy for bathtime. There were plenty of blankets, extra towels, and pillows. When we first got there Heather took us around the house to show us everything. It was pretty cold when we were there, but there was a heater in each room, perfect for night time. I didn't have to worry about my son getting cold at night. There was a full fridge, microwave, toaster oven, hot plate for cooking, plenty of dishes for eating. Lots of space for dining and an extra living room to hang out/play in. My son loved wandering the house, to find all the new nooks and crannies he could explore. The bed was super comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and warm blankets. The highlight of our trip, for sure.",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"Everything was perfect during our stay here! We were big fans of the cottage and it’s ease of location for us to get around (Groceries, restaurants, coffee, and shopping are in walking distance). We used the hot plate and toaster oven for our cooking needs, making it very easy to save some money instead of going out to eat! The space is perfect for two and had fun amenities like a very large TV and varied National Geographic magazines. We had everything we needed and Heather was a fantastic host. We’re looking to stay here again when looking for apartments before we move to Tacoma. Definitely recommended!",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,Heather's place was such a great find!!  We came to WA to visit my sister.  Our flight landed at 10 and after getting the rental and finding some food we showed up at 12.  But Heather was still there waiting to show us around and to give us the key.  Such a nice and friendly lady!!! The cottage was very cute and I loved that there was a.c. and that we could park right outside the front door.  Neighborhood was very safe and quiet.  I would definitely stay here again when I come back to visit.  Thank you Heather and family for an amazing stay.  Especially demo!!,Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"Our second visit with Ms Heather.  Better than the first.  From making the keys available to us (she was out of town) and then having a family member check on us to make sure all was well, everything was first class.  The cottage was very clean, all amenities were available and useable, and the serenity was very appreciated.  Awesome job with a book of ""things to do"" to include restaurants and places to see.  Any request made was met with immediate action and assistance.  Highly recommend Ms Heather and the Cozy Cottage.",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"Heather was so hospitable that staying at her cottage felt like visiting family. She kindly held the cottage for me beyond the reservation deadline while I found a friend with a smartphone to help me verify my ID. Because my husband and I were there without a car, she drove me to the Fred Meyer for groceries when I arrived. (In future, though, I will probably look for someplace that's more walkable--handier to restaurants. You need a smartphone or a tablet to order from Domino's Pizza, and Jimmy John's said we were outside of their delivery range.) The cottage was super clean and the neighborhood very quiet and safe.",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"This was my second time using Air Bnb and my mother’s first and we both absolutely loved the Cozzy Cottage experience! We traveled all the way from New Jersey and this place literally felt like our home away from home. The neighborhood is super cute and most important, very safe. The Host Heather is so nice and her hospitality was AMAZING!  The Cottage is located in front of Heather’s home so she is there if you need her for anything. Heather checked up on my mother and I a few times during the week which really warmed our hearts to see she cared how we were doing. One night Heather even stopped by and brought us popcorn, it was honestly the perfect snack to end our night. Heather also knew we were there visiting my new baby nephew, and my mother’s first grandchild, and she gave us a gift for him too, which was above and beyond anything she had to do.   Things we loved about the Cozzy Cottage,  the beds are sooo comfy, literally every morning when my mother and I woke up all we kept saying was what a great night sleep we got. I also thought it was cool how there’s a door to the living room area where I stayed. When I pulled out the sofa bed at  night and closed the door, I got privacy and the living room turned into a second bedroom. The cottage is also super affordable, we paid half the cost of what a hotel was charging us in the area and got so much more. It’s also a mile from restaurants and grocery stores which we went to often.  Heather also provided us with a well organized folder with menus to nearby restaurants.   Overall my Mother and I give the Cozzy Cottage 5 stars all around. I will definitely be coming back to stay here in the near future. We also recommended the Cottage to our other family members that are coming to visit soon.   ",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,"Heather is the epitome of “super host”! When we checked in, she was not there at the time (volunteering), but we talked on the phone! She then brought our daughter popcorn back and we chatted for a while; she is just the sweetest person ever! The cottage was absolutely perfect for our little family and it was nice that Heather had books and games for us to play with! I am originally from Tacoma, so if you were wondering about the location, it is very central to everything in Tacoma! We visited family in Lakewood, which only took about a fifteen minute drive and then we went out to dinner on the other side of Tacoma and that was only a ten minute drive. We will definitely come back and stay at this cozy cottage!! Thank you Heather!!!",Tacoma,0
Private Cozy Cottage,Our experience in Heathers Cottage was awesome. The Cottage had everything and the Location was perfect. (next to Tacomas Community College) It was super confortable and there were many reachable super markets like Fred Meyer just 5 minutes away by walking.  Heather gave us a very lovely welcome and she gave us many informations about things to do in Tacoma. She was super kind and always there for Questions or help. I would come back here anytime if i stay in Tacoma again! Big Recommendation!   David & Sae,Tacoma,0
Cozy quiet 1 bedroom in NorthTacoma,"Ernie and Lenora have a beautiful, quiet, and spotlessly clean home, and a lovely garden.  They are excellent hosts who are kind, considerate, and thoughtful.  The comfort of guests is their top priority.  They provide a coffee maker in the room, and breakfast items in the kitchen each morning, which is such a great help.  Lenora puts flowers from their garden in your room, which is a lovely and thoughtful touch.  They provide everything you need; you don't have to worry about bringing shampoo or Q-tips.  Everything is there!  The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and safe.  It's also walkable; restaurants, a bank, and a pharmacy are a short walk away, and you can easily drive to top attractions in Tacoma.  Ernie and Lenora are definitely super hosts; we had a wonderful stay in their home for four nights, and they were so generous and accommodating when we were unable to arrive on our expected date.",Tacoma,0
Cozy quiet 1 bedroom in NorthTacoma,"Ernie and Lenora were amazing hosts and their hospitality is off the charts. The check-in process was seamless.

The mattress was soft and led to one of the best sleeping experiences I have had in a long time. Ernie has lived in the Seattle/Tacoma area his entire life and had so many great tips about where to go and what to see.  I highly recommend staying with them!!!!!",Tacoma,0
Cozy quiet 1 bedroom in NorthTacoma,"Lenora and Ernie were warm and hospitable hosts.  They had clear instructions for check in and Lenora went through how to open/lock the door, the common areas that could be used, and the breakfast snacks that were available for Airbnb guests.  The room was a good size and the bed was super comfy and could comfortably fit two people.  I liked how they had put a Keurig, water and little brochures of local activities and places in the bookcase.  The room and bathroom were nicely decorated, very clean, and they even provided shampoo/conditioner and little soaps!  I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend these hosts!",Tacoma,0

The bus stop is within a short walking distance and took me straight to downtown Tacoma in 30 minutes.  The host and hostess were very kind and amenable.  There were dishes left out specifically for my use and space in the refrigerator downstairs set aside for me as well.  It was quiet and peaceful, just right to get some last minute studying done.  Overall, great experience and great price. ",Tacoma,0
Cozy quiet 1 bedroom in NorthTacoma,"Lenora and Ernie are warm and hospitable. They offered clear directions and instructions and Lenora was accommodating when I texted to check in early.

Theater District Loft,"This is a perfect location for a stay in downtown Tacoma. It is convenient to shops and restaurants. It is also very convenient to the complimentary Link rail system so you can get all the way to the Tacoma Dome or other attractions like the Museum of Glass in a few minutes.  The accommodations are comfortable, clean, and soothing.  There is a lot of bright light through the windows, but curtains and shades for privacy as well.  There is a nearby bar that is lively on the weekend so bring some earplugs if you are a light sleeper, otherwise just enjoy the sounds of the city.  Parking on the street was not a problem for us. Our host left detailed instructions that were easy to follow and her communication was great throughout the entire process. We loved our stay. Thank you so much!",Tacoma,0
Theater District Loft,"GREAT Location. Nearly across the street from Pantages Theater, 2 blocks from Dorky's, 3 blocks from the Matador and a cool little bar called The Office (both of which have great food, the way). Tons of places to see and go within walking distance.   We live 15 miles away but wanted a night away from the norm and I am SO GLAD we stayed here. The pictures do not do this space justice, not to mention the good vibes too. It is much bigger than I imagined, and had everything we needed.   We will be back again. :)",Tacoma,0
Theater District Loft,"Fantastic location, stylish loft, gracious hostess! It’s a very comfortable space and was perfect for our girls weekend. Be aware that there are stairs (read pack light) and the bars might be a little loud on the weekend (read if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs) but we enjoyed everything about our stay:  chefs kitchen, spa-like bathroom, and comfortable furniture. Denise also provided lots of recommendations for brunch, local services and even street parking information. I look forward to returning! Mahalo!",Tacoma,0

I plan to make this my go-to when coming back to the area, and wouldn’t hesitate to book again. The experience was great and the host is awesome! Denise was quick to respond and a great host.

Old Town Studio...Great Location & Water View!!,"This is my second time at Christiana’s place. The location can’t be beat. Old Town is a great little spot in Tacoma with lots to do, and easy access to l-5. Coffee shops, restaurants and an excellent walking path along the bay just blocks away. The studio is clean, comfortable and has a spectacular view of Commencement Bay. Christiana’s personal touches make it extra special, fresh flowers, and snacks. There’s a Kuereg coffee maker with pods, a small fridge and a microwave. The studio has a real peaceful, serene vibe. I sleep better there than I do at home. That being said, the bed is super comfortable. This is now my home away from home while in Tacoma. I sure appreciate having such a nice place to stay while I’m in town. Thank you Christiana, and thank you for checking in with me to make sure everything was alright, and asking if I had everything I needed. Christiana is definitely a super host that goes the extra mile.",Tacoma,0

The kitchenette has a Kuereg coffee maker, k-cups and half and half in the mini fridge. There was a basket of toiletries in the bathroom (toothpaste, toothbrushes, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant and face cleanser). The space is bright, warm and comfortable.

North Tacoma Nights,"Linda/Mike were great hosts! Super quick responses in communication and their rooms were much bigger than expected! Only thing that was unexpected is that the beds are water beds. First for me to sleep on one, and it was quite different. Not necessary uncomfortable but unfamiliar for someone who has never slept on one. There was miscommunication on check-out time. Advertised on Airbnb was 1pm however Linda/Mike thought 12pm. We weren’t prepared for a 12pm check out as we planned for 1pm per what was on Airbnb. Linda/Mike thought we knew it was a 12pm check out and when we told our hosts we thought 1pm, they did not rush us at all, even though they had to prep for their next reservations at 2pm. We did our best to rush check out as it was a miscommunication that was not on Linda/Mike. Definitely would stay again with Linda/Mike. Very respectfully in giving us our space but very accommodating to all our needs.",Tacoma,0
North Tacoma Nights,"This was like visiting family in the best way possible.  Linda greeted us and I immediately felt at home.  She gave us ""the tour"" right away and very thoroughly.  Lovely accommodations for my adult daughter and myself (we need separate bedrooms!) with coffee maker, fridge, and fresh water.  The beds were SO comfortable as was the bathroom.  I like the way that our space was separate from the hosts' space, yet they were totally available.  BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK.  You want to stay here!!!  Great parking as well!",Tacoma,0

Linda & Mike were so friendly and welcoming, they made us feel at home right away and are truly amazing hosts! I’d highly recommend their place if you’re in the area!",Tacoma,0
North Tacoma Nights,Mike and Linda were great hosts. Their home is set up perfect to allow privacy as wanted. The rooms are above the garage while their living quarters and area are on the other side of the home. The room was perfect temperature and comfortable. I loved being able to have a cup of coffee in my room and takin my time getting up. I could sit comfortably in the glider reading or propped up in bed with four pillows. I enjoyed getting local fruits and keeping them on hand with the mini fridge. The bathroom was very clean and tidy. Most of all I just enjoyed getting to know them in our morning chats before I left for my daily excursions. They are very welcoming and have the coolest hobby restoring 1950-70’s era furniture. Really nice down to earth hosts that go out of their way to be sure you are comfortable and have all you need. I’ll be back I’m sure. ;),Tacoma,0
North Tacoma Nights,"Mike and Linda were absolutely wonderful hosts! They greeted us at the door with smiles and helped us bring our luggage in.

Getting around was really simple, most restaurants and shops were just within a few miles, and there are gorgeous beaches on either side of town. Definitely would recommend to anyone! A lovely, peaceful home in a beautiful town!",Tacoma,0
North Tacoma Nights,"Linda and Mike are amazing. The space is just as described and although the bathroom is at bottom of the stairs it’s not shared and is super easy to get to/from....There is plenty of privacy at that end of the house due to the floor plan/lay out so it doesn’t feel (Website hidden by Airbnb) perfect.   The location is at the end of a road so there is privacy, easy parking and it’s easy to come and go without feeling like you are bothering the hosts or the neighbors.   Linda is super easy to reach, responds promptly and is super kind. We met Mike too upon check out and enjoyed our conversation with both of them. They do make sure you have all the privacy you need so interacting is completely optional. We felt we could relax and didn’t feel obligated to interact...we just chose to do so.   I would recommend their place to family and friends when staying in Tacoma. We were super happy with it. Will stay again if the need arises. :)",Tacoma,0
Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,"If you are looking for a peaceful, quiet, beautiful place to stay (with hosts that care about your comfort, needs, & pocketbook), then look no further.  Bob & Sharann’s place provides not only a reasonably priced stay, but in addition, a lovely patio, a place to store & heat food, a fireplace (my personal favorite!), coffee, & snacks.  Another thing that puts them a cut above other places, is they check-in to see if you need anything and go out of their way to help, if they are able.  It is nice to know that you are taken care of while at their place.   It truly felt like a home away from home.",Tacoma,0
Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,"We had such a wonderful experience at this amazing space! We realized right away that Bob and Sharann could easily charge twice the amount they are asking for each night, just because of the value of the place alone.

Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,Bob and Sharann were perfect hosts. I stayed with them for three weeks during my relocation to JBLM. The room is private with its own bathroom.  it’s so much better than staying in a hotel room. Local eating establishments are with in walking distance. The room is very spacious. Since I was relocating I had more stuff than just traveling. They were gracious enough to let me check in early since I was coming from overseas. They were very gracious to drive me to my new house in the neighborhood since I did not have a car yet. I highly recommend selecting this location if you are relocating. Definitely a five star location.,Tacoma,0
Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,"I'm not going to bury the lede on this one: the toilet lights up. That's all I needed to start the petition for 10 stars on Airbnb. Now to the boring part of the review: Bob and Sharann's suite was exactly what I was looking for on my one-night stay. Even though I got in pretty late (flying from the east coast) their warm welcome was quite comforting after a long day of travel. The suite was very clean and had quite a few thoughtful touches. As a cold-natured person, the heated blanket was a mega-bonus (besides the toilet - don't forget the toilet). Great stay!",Tacoma,0
Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,"Bob and Sharann’s place is an excellent option for staying in the DuPont area.

There is a door that connects the suite to the rest of the house, but this remains locked during the entire stay for your privacy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable option in the area!",Tacoma,0

We slept like rocks in that cozy bed, really enjoyed the large open shower, swang on the patio swing eating the snacks Bob and Sharann left for us, and chilled out with some Netflix on their large screen. SUPER CLEAN, marvelous hospitality and the extra touches were superb. The location is just off of I-5 and there is everything you could possibly need right nearby. We explored Mt. Rainier, Olympus and St. Helens and also spent a whole day in Seattle (even caught a Mariners game). I picked an absolute winner, you should too. ",Tacoma,0
Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,"Wow, there are so many reasons why this place is a 5-star choice for your lodging needs in DuPont! The suite is convenient and comfortable, yet private and peaceful. From your own private entrance and parking spot to the private bath and secluded garden patio, all things were perfectly appointed! The queen size wooden sleigh bed is comfortable, and the entire suite is both roomy yet cozy. Check-in with Bob and Sharann was outstanding. He even helped carry our luggage in...completely unexpected! We have family in the area who live in a small apartment so we just needed a place to sleep. This suite was perfect for us, and we will probably book again on our next visit.",Tacoma,0
Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,"Bob and Sharann are great hosts. Their 5 star suite deserves that title. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels, and it is right up there with them. The decor is beautiful! The bed is comfortable, and there are so many extra touches, such as the basket of goodies, coffee maker, microwave,  and mini fridge. Our favorite was sitting out in the private patio, drinking our morning coffee, or having an afternoon cocktail. Bob and Sharrann have thought of everything to make their guests comfortable and happy. We will stay with them whenever we visit Du Pont.",Tacoma,0
Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,"We were invited to a wedding at Thornwood Castle but didn't want to pay the high nightly rate to stay in a hotel in the area. Always doing ""entire place"" Airbnb rentals, we were a little nervous at staying at Bob and Sharann's private room. However, we couldn't have been happier. The great pride that they take in their unit is evident from the comfy bed, array of towels, and personalized welcome message in the room. They really have thought of everything! They were also such gracious hosts--they gave us a lovely history of the area, had brochures from local restaurants, and even little mints on the bed side stand. Would highly recommend",Tacoma,0
Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,"From the very start Bob and Sharann were warm and welcoming.  They made sure our stay was everything we wanted it to be!  They even checked in before going out of town for a couple days to see if we needed anything before they left. The accommodation was so much nicer than we expected!  It was more spacious than we thought and the bed was so comfortable.  The bathroom/shower is like new and the walk in closet provided plenty of space for storage and for the kitchen items.  The outside space is beautiful too.  With its own entrance the whole space, inside and out, felt very private.  It was super clean too!  We would highly recommend this space as it was much nicer and way less expensive than a luxury hotel.  It was an amazing stay!",Tacoma,0

We kept very long hours during our holiday, typically returning to our suite after midnight, so we were glad that we didn't need to disturb our hosts too much.  We would definitely stay here again, given the opportunity, and highly recommend it to everyone!",Tacoma,0
Beautiful Five Star Suite with Private Entrance,"This was probably the best Air BNB I stayed in. Great service and hospitality by the hosts. They checked up on me occasionally to make sure everything was going well. Room was clean, spacious, and they do complementary linen change and room cleanings at the end of each week. I especially loved how I got my own guest parking spot, private entrance, and private bathroom. It was like my own apartment, and I got a lot of privacy overall. The area is very lovely to walk around and convenient too. I am not surprised on why this listing is almost always booked.",Tacoma,0
"Private beach cabin, Vashon Island","This place was absolutely wonderful. We stayed here for a weekend to attend a wedding on Vashon and it was an easy 10-15 minute drive to the venue on the south side of the island. The space was cozy and clean and Chip (and his sweet dog Olive) thought of everything! They provided coffee, a French Press, and an espresso machine, plenty of tea, and had a handbook of suggestions for places around the island. We found the inclusion of some fun games and activities to be very charming as well. We'd love to return to spend more time here!",Tacoma,0
"Private beach cabin, Vashon Island","Wow ... what a sweet little cottage by the beach ... all the amenities, and Chip is an exemplary host - flexible, cordial and there if needed ... full access to yard and beach, with high tides rising half way up the bulkhead - a few feet down the ladder and you are in the swim - seriously, who needs a dock ... still, I might want flippers in those waters - the current looks swift to me ... still, a great place to swim, if you can handle the cold ... water clear, you can see through to the rocks at the bottom ... anyway, a great place to stay, a wonderful getaway, spring green forest - and more affordable than any hotels/motels in the area ... there are some other AirBnB locations, a few bead and breakfasts on the islands ... most look more expensive to me ... so, if you are looking to spend some time at the beach, in a lovely, quiet space - right on the beach - check in with Chip ... you'll be happy you did!",Tacoma,0
"Private beach cabin, Vashon Island","Chip's place was absolutely perfect for a relaxing couple of days. It felt very secluded and quiet, but was just ~15 minutes driving from downtown Vashon. The cabin itself was cozy, spotless and extremely comfortable. Chip provided everything you need: coffee, tea, toiletries, extra pillows and blankets, etc. I especially love the view of the water and the private deck. It was a nice walk down the rocky beach to the lighthouse. It would be absolutely perfect for a romantic couple of days with a loved one...winter (drinking hot drinks, watching the storms over the water) or summer (enjoying the sunshine, walking on the beach). I would definitely return and would highly recommend!",Tacoma,0
"Private beach cabin, Vashon Island","Chip's place is a great getaway!  My wife and I wanted a place that felt far away, but didn't take hours and hours to get to.  This fit the bill.  We really enjoyed the little thoughts that went into the place.  Clean, nicely decorated interior.  A newer wood deck that wraps around the front.  A view of the sound.  And, a warm gas fireplace on a cold weekend.  If you've made it this far into my review, go ahead and pull the trigger and stay at Chip's.  I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as we did.",Tacoma,0
"Private beach cabin, Vashon Island","Chip's studio cottage is delightful. It's a very comfortable studio for two, with a spacious living area you can spread out in a little and enjoy your stay. The kitchen area works well; although there's no range, the two-burner hot place was sufficient for cooking our simple meals, and the electric kettle kept us in tea and coffee. (Provided!) The queen bed was very comfortable, and the gas fireplace kept the cottage plenty warm.   The french doors in the living room open out on to a very nice deck, with a view across the yard to the water, and across to the mainland. The cottage is at the back of the yard, so be aware you don't have an expansive view of the sound from inside the cottage. As you look out at the water, the main house is on the left and a boundary hedge is on the right. You do have access to the beach, however. There are adirondack chairs set out and there's a short set of steps from the yard down to the beach. And the view there IS expansive!  This is a super quiet location that's about as far as you can get from the Vashon business district. We wanted quiet and privacy, and this suits the bill perfectly. We hardly heard a sound our entire stay -- I think we heard one car drive by on the road. We didn't run into Chip while we were there, but he let us know he was available and he responded immediately to any messages. We did get a visit from his very sweet dog Olive, though, who I'm sure was curious to see who was in the cottage for the weekend. She likes ear rubs. :-)    All in all, it's a lovely place to get away from the city and just get some peaceful downtime. Recommended!",Tacoma,0
"Private beach cabin, Vashon Island","This cabin provided such a lovely respite. It is so quiet and peaceful there. Chip has thought of helpful features like curtains on either side of the bed to keep out the morning light. The kitchen is basic and rustic, not suitable for extensive cooking, but it had everything I needed. Chip is a great host and his dog Olive is the sweetest! It's so nice being so close to the water. At high tide you can't access the beach, but there are chairs on the bulkhead so you can still sit and enjoy the water. Chip provides a tide table so you know when the tide is low. I saw seals or sea lions out in the water every day I was there. I hope to be back in the summer months!",Tacoma,0
"Private beach cabin, Vashon Island","Chip's place is LOVELY!    In some ways, I'd have to say that it's not as described because it was bigger and nicer than I anticipated from the photos!  The living room area is about 1 and a half times bigger than the bed area, there are tall closets for hanging, a couch, TV with cable, gas stove, and a small table from which you can see the water.  The kitchen has the basics, including a two burner plug-in for cooking, and a nice long counter for all your stuff.  The entire cottage is wood paneled and has fun little touches like a funky port window in the bathroom and a long skinny window to see out to the BBQ area.  The porch has a table and chairs for outside eating or two other chairs for lounging.  You can see the water from the main living space and from the porch, and you can walk down to the rocky beach itself at low tide. Chip's house is just across the lawn, but not visible from the cottage.  The cottage is on a quiet, remote road, but is only about 15 minutes from the main downtown part of Vashon.  Chip was very available and responsive and sweet Olive the dog is eager for a pet if you want to call her over.  Book now!  Unless we've beat you to it for a repeat visit!",Tacoma,0
"Private beach cabin, Vashon Island","I had originally planned this trip with my husband, but my parents surprised me last minute for my birthday so I decided to come with them instead. The day of the trip, I realized that the cabin was only supposed to welcome 2 people so I told Chip, and he was very nice at accommodating this last minute change. The place is so stylish, it has everything you need for an awesome time (coffee, teas, grill, salt, pepper, monopoly, fire)....during the day we walked up the hill to a lighthouse, we grilled, and sat in the morning on the deck for a nice cup of tea. I will absolutely come back!  Chip came to welcome us when we arrived. An awesome experience. ",Tacoma,0
"Private beach cabin, Vashon Island","I couldn't have asked for a better host. Chip communicated quickly and easily and made our stay in Vashon a stress free one. The house is right by the water with a beautiful view. It does get pretty cold at night but there's a cute fire heater. Chip left a little booklet describing the island, local stores, the basics around the house (wifi etc.) and even suggested the kite, boardgames and grill on the patio. The house catered to a relaxing and freeing weekend. I highly recommend dipping your feet in the water it'll definitely wake you up.   Overall, we had a fantastic stay and will for sure be back to see Chip and Oliver (his dog) again.",Tacoma,0
Charming Cozy Designer Home- Private House,"Maggie’s place is in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood, which is perfect for recharging after schlepping yourself around all day. The beds were soft, the shower was hot and we had all the comforts of home even though we were far from it.

If we come back, we will book with Maggie before looking anywhere else.",Forest Hills,0
Charming Cozy Designer Home- Private House,"I usually right longer reviews but I really have to simply say that Maggie's place is AWESOME. FANTASTIC. FABULOUS.  It is one of the truly cleanest airbnb's I've stayed in.    It has absolutely the best accommodation for sleeping plus one besides yourself.  The shower has an amazing removable head with excellent water pressure and ridiculous hot water flow as desired.  So very accessible into the city...  And a hop on the LIE for a drive to Long Island.  I can see how parking could be tough but it really isn't (Website hidden by Airbnb) also scored a spot right in front ;)  The snacks and coffee provided made me feel right at home and came in handy for my late arrival to have a little something before going to bed and getting up early the next day for a packed schedule.  Whether it's for business or pleasure, Maggie's place is PERFECT.  I will be back again and hope it is available!",Forest Hills,0
Charming Cozy Designer Home- Private House,"Maggie & John are so wonderful and accommodating! If you’re looking for a safe, convenient, quiet, and clean place to stay for your NYC visit, look no further!  We were arriving early and Maggie was kind enough to make sure we’d be able to check in by the time we get there. THE DETAILS were everything. For a cozy spot, this had all the conveniences that were cleverly designed in the space. We were close enough to make trips to Brooklyn and Manhattan no prob.   Maggie was ever so accommodating! We had a late flight out and wanted to explore Queens & Flushing before heading to JKF, but had no where to store our luggage. We checked in with Maggie and she said it was ok to leave it in our unit in the meantime! Best host or what!?",Forest Hills,0
Charming Cozy Designer Home- Private House,"Maggie and John are wonderful and thoughtful hosts anyone could ask for!

The place was very nicely decorated and we had everything we needed, plenty of linens, towels, snacks and drinks! Our flight arrived at 9am so Maggie very graciously allowed us to drop our bags off in the morning before we headed in to the city. The beds were comfortable and K-cups were provided so we could make coffee in the morning. The townhome is about a 10 minute walk from the Rigo Park station, where you can easily get on the subway to head to Manhattan or further into Queens, depending on your activities for the day. The place was very clean and comfortable...we couldn't recommend it more! Thank you, Maggie!",Forest Hills,0
Charming Cozy Designer Home- Private House,"Maggie’s place was outstanding. Super cute, stylish, and clean. She was quick to reply when we had questions.

It is a bit away from the city (30min-1hr) min ride via bus and subway, which means it is really quiet! The place was very clean and stylish. There is a house manual that is pretty helpful and the hosts provide their contact info too! They offer an excellent amount of snacks for you and your guests. They even provide little candies on each bed! The lock system is very efficient as it does not require your phone or easy-to-lose items like keys.

Maggie was also super fast in responding to inquiries through the Airbnb chat. Answered questions during our stay within minutes.   Location was great, a few food places around the area and few shops including malls. The drive to Manhattan was fine during weekend. Parking on the street was tough, but there is a parking garage for $25 per night just 5 min walk from the home.  Overall, we have nothing but positive memories.

A real attempt was made to make our stay hospitable. Only hiccup was entry on arrival. But, that was sorted swiftly. Loved the small touches like the postcards in the rack. Didn't use them, though.... I phoned my family every other day. But, there was coffee, beers in the fridge, coffee maker, noodle pots, etc, all there on arrival. Couldn't ask for more. This was our honeymoon and our first airbnb experience and it was a very good one. We both felt like we had a great time. So, a big thumbs up from us.

Beginning from exact check-in instructions and information folder. There was a touchy gesture with welcome snacks and drinks in the refrigerator. There were all possible cosmetic skin  and hair caring products in the bathroom. The kitchen possessed all necessary items for preparing meals. The beds were comfortable.

"Luxury House in Safe Area, 30 Min to Time Square","This was my second time staying in Igor's and May's home, but my first time staying in this room. The house, as it was during my last stay, still amazing: it's a beautiful space that is well-maintained by May. There are 2 bathrooms: the bathroom on the second floor is mostly shared by you and the other AirBNB room, and the bathroom on the first floor is mostly used by May, but you're allowed to use it too (and it has a cool Japanese toilet!) This room is much larger than the listing under May's account; this room is basically 2 rooms: the main room and the attic. The attic actually has more floor space than the main room, but you have to duck down a bit while walking around. The main room has a private balcony attached. Both rooms have their own AC units.  Again, May and Igor are terrific hosts. They leave you to your own devices but are up for conversation if that's what you want. This listing is a gem, especially considering it's in Forest Hills, which is basically the Beverly Hills of New York. It's about a 15-minute walk from the subway, but it's a lovely and safe walk.",Forest Hills,0

The feedback from my parents that I received is that the room is nice and clean as per the description. Access to the nearest public transport to the city is very close. Safe neighbourhood and very good value for money. Will definitely recommend other AirBnB hosts to stay at Igor's!

"Luxury House in Safe Area, 30 Min to Time Square","The house is well decorated and close to JF Kennedy airport, just 20 min drive. Free parking is available by roadside nearby.  We had a room upstairs with a cute loft, which is especially great for a family with kid, though we didn’t use it. The only pity is that no cooking is allowed, as it is a shared living place.  Igor is nice and quick in response, and we really thank him for keeping our luggages even after check-out time.",Forest Hills,0
"Luxury House in Safe Area, 30 Min to Time Square",Hi just stayed at igors place for 4nights it’s a shared house and in a very nice area but we managed to find our way round using combination of buses and subway. So only a short bus ride and tube to central New York in about 25 minutes. The house is very well looked after and is clean and tidy but we did feel like we should be quiet and that made it a little weird. But they made us feel welcome and we would recommend.,Forest Hills,0

"Luxury House in Safe Area, 30 Min to Time Square",Clean place is a lovely upscale neighbourhood.  You can take a bus to the subway or enjoy a lovely walk through the upscale neighbourhood.  I’d say it’s about 15 min and then a quick ride on the E train to Manhattan.   The bed was very comfortable and AC worked well.  A nice selection of shampoo/body wash is available in the shower.   There is a walk out private porch.     Great Value and I would stay again.  ,Forest Hills,0

❤ Instagram worthy view! Luxury High-rise Downtown,"We enjoyed our stay at Rod's place! The pictures are accurate, and the view is truly amazing. The apartment was clean, and we loved the amenities such as the outdoor pool, the game room with pool table, the gym, and the roof deck where we could see the Navy Pier fireworks in the distance. The location worked well. Not far from the subway, walking distance to many attractions, and several restaurants and convenience stores right there in case we needed something. We did not meet Rod, but he communicated almost immediately when we had questions, offered helpful tips with public transit, and his check-in directions were clear. Very happy with this experience!",Chicago,1
2BR Bursting w/ Character in Hip Logan Square!,"Danielle's place is very roomy, clean, and comfortable to stay in.  Everything you need is in her place even a washing machine and dryer.  The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself.  My sister and her family loved staying there.  They had two small children and there was plenty of room for everything that they brought.  There is also a nice fenced in backyard living space when the weather is nice for you to enjoy.  I would highly recommend Danielle's place for your next trip to Chicago.  It is within walking distance of Logan Square and all it has to offer.",Chicago,1
2BR Bursting w/ Character in Hip Logan Square!,"If you want to have a a good time in Chicago, don't stay at Danielle's place.....
If you want to have A FABULOUS TIME IN CHICAGO, STAY HERE!
I cannot rave about this place enough. So cozy. So well equipped with everything you could ever need. Danielle has a very charming place with thoughtful touches all around. 
Heated floors, a fireplace, fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. We felt right at home. My colleagues and I kept looking around saying, ""I love this place. I don't want to leave"". On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta! I will definiltey be recommending this to anyone and everyone who plans to visit Chicago. BONUS: Just down the street from the best diner/vegan food in the world.",Chicago,1
Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park,"We had a wonderful stay at Heather and JP's apartment. The apartment is very fresh and clean. It's lovely decorated and the kitchenette is well equipped. There is a wonderful garden which is an oasis of peace in the busy city of Chicago. The location is great, only a 5 to 10 minute walk from Division & Milwaukee CTA subway station. Round the corner on Milwaukee Avenue there's a bus stop with buses going downtown. It's very quiet at night which offers you a great sleep. Heather and JP are great hosts who will help you with all your questions.

All in all we had a very comfortable stay. We would definitely recommend this place to family and friends.",Chicago,1
"Charming, Spacious 1BR Studio in Belmont Cragin","We absolutely loved our say in Christopher's place. While it is a basement space, it has all the privacy you need including your own entrance. The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus. 

We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",Chicago,1
Cozy Coach House,"Scott and Jill are wonderful hosts who worked extremely responsively with us as our scheduled arrival changed. They helped us figure out some of the neighborhoods we were looking for an apartment, gave us some tips on cool places to eat, and introduced us to their sweet doggo, Bonnie.

Their garage loft is a lovely, very clean space in a very quiet neighborhood. You walk through their beautiful garden and backyard, through their garage, and up into the spacious, well-lit space. There’s a full sized bathroom (bigger than most hotel rooms), decked out kitchen, and comfy sitting nook.

Great for couples and families, or just the solo traveler that needs some quiet space!",Chicago,1
Foodie Paradise in Logan Square area - Sunny 1 BDR,"I took a Chicago staycation to finish my book and Natalia's second-floor apartment was the perfect getaway. It was more than roomy for me, being just one traveler, but I loved the amount of space and light she creates in your classic Chicago ""long-but-not-wide"" floorplan. There was more than enough light and her cheerful plants and art made me feel right at home. Small touches like a welcome note, snacks, and a guide to the neighborhood were wonderful and I actually found two amazing eateries during my stay thanks to her helpful guidance.

Water was always hot. Automatic lights and Nest heat made me feel spoiled. And there were ample towels, toiletries, and plateware to be found. I literally rolled in with my suitcase and I was home.

If I were to make any change, it would be the small addition of having more blankets or comforters available. The heat in the apartment was perfect but I like to sleep under many layers at night (I struggle with this at hotels too!).",Chicago,1
Foodie Paradise in Logan Square area - Sunny 1 BDR,"Our stay at Natalia’s was wonderful and we’d come back again - it was as pictured but even better in person. We loved all the plants, the way it was furnished, a very unique space and very comfortable and clean. We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and little touches like the book with suggestions and handwritten welcome. The area is great too - there’s lots of restaurants and cute shops nearby. Uncharted books was a favourite of ours. In our opinion it was nice to stay out of downtown yet still close to anything you may need. Natalia was also a great host she communicated clearly and even checked in with us to make sure all was well. Thanks Natalia!",Chicago,1
Hot Tub Heaven,"Loveeeeee this place! Its make me and my friend feel like a home-y! We barely couldn’t get out of bed. We had relaxing vibe around here. This is the best best best birthday surprise for my best friend and she love it! So is Marilee, a dog was too chilling! This is our first best experience ever to book the first Airbnb spot! I’m so glad I chose the right one! Thank you so much for allowing us to stay extra night!! We couldn’t stop talking about how much we had so much fun and we literally chilling lot there. Your place are so relaxing and perfect for stress-free mini vacation!

For anyone you who planning on going to Chicago! Book this place! Trust me, it’s a lifesaver! These hosts are extremely outgoing, lovely couple with sweet personality! They would check on you to make sure everything you need to keep you comfort! 

Oh on behalf, I couldn’t live without their outdoor hot tub and mediated room! ❤️",Chicago,1
Hot Tub Heaven,"Where do I begin?! My boyfriend and I are an eclectic couple, and staying in the artsy, eclectic unit of Steven and Sara’s couldn’t have been more perfect. We loved looking at all the artwork and woodwork in the house, and we were more than comfortable. It honestly felt like staying with friends as Steven and Sara were both very friendly and inviting, and we had a great time conversing with them. They both went out of their way to help us and make us comfortable. We will be back next time we are in Chicago!",Chicago,1
Joe's Place in West Portage Park,"Joe's place is a great place to stay! The bedroom is very simple with a big bed for two, two chairs, a full length mirror, a bedside table, and a lamp. There are six outlets, and although only four of them work, that's plenty for one room. The bathroom is clean, and the shower has great temperature control. The shower can also be a jacuzzi, which is fun. The towels he provides are very soft and very plentiful. Joe was having some electrical issues in the bathroom, so he put in a lamp. However, in the daytime, sun shines in through the skylight, providing natural light in the bathroom. He provides full use of his kitchen, even offering eggs, bread, and lots of pots, pans, and kitchen utensils. We kept a deep-dish pizza in his refrigerator and microwaved it in the morning to eat, using his kitchen knives and plates. We didn't use the living room too much but the seats looked very nice. The floors were clean enough that I walked around barefoot without an issue. The house was temperature controlled and the door had a keyless entry number pad. The best part of the stay was Joe himself. He is a sweet man who is very willing to chat and share his life experiences with his guests. Being kind of young, we were a bit apprehensive about meeting him, but he put us at ease completely. He was completely un-creepy, which can sometimes be hard to find in older men as an East Asian - American. I appreciated his conversation and his excitement at sharing the house with us. He's a lovely, kind man who doesn't unnecessarily interfere with his guests and makes sure that we treat the house as if we were his roommates. I felt at ease and well rested at Joe's place!",Chicago,1
Light Filled Loft Apartment near Downtown Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee).
Communication with Jeremy was very easy. 
If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",Chicago,1
"Luxury Chicago Loft, 1 blk to train w/ 2 pkg spots","Our four days at this incredible loft were some of our favorite traveling days to date! The loft is amazing, clean, and spacious. We enjoyed coffee on the terrace overlooking the street. The neighborhood is clean and charming, and we loved walking around Wrigley Field and Lakeview. The loft is located super close to the L station, and we liked being able to use the train for the duration of our stay. This was our best AirBnb experience ever, and Jay and Elisa were helpful and communicative. We will definitely stay here again!",Chicago,1
Modern Chicago Loft with a Complimentary Garage Spot,"We loved it! The apartment was in a safe area (our number one priority). It was BEAUTIFUL and the bed was the MOST comfortable we have ever slept on. It was centrally located next to cvs, a food store, etc... walking distance. Dasha responded quickly anytime for anything we asked. We loved they had coffee in the unit and creamer in the fridge. I know this probably was Not their norm but it was a nice touch to leave it there. There isn’t a dishwasher and the microwave is on the bottom drawer but this didn’t bother us. We were so pleased with everything else, we would forfeit those for what we did have. Keyless entry into the building and into the apartment. It was extremely clean and we had shampoo and soap (also important to us). The towels were plenty for us and thankful for an extra one just in case we needed it. Oh, and we LOVED having Netflix available. This was Brian and mine once a year get away from the responsibilities of life (kids, dogs, careers) and we loved the ability to “Netflix and chill” w each other. We want to come back soon for a quick weekend getaway and maybe bring the kids next time. Although we would have to have a different unit for the kids, we would definitely try to stay at one of Dasha’s properties (she has a few to choose from). Thank you Dasha for everything. :)",Chicago,1
"Modern, Open, Loft in Chicago's Logan Square","We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided. 

Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help. 

Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive. 

The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.

On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.

Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.

If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.

Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",Chicago,1
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"Our group of 6 loved our stay at the Polk Street Coach House. We felt very safe the entire time and enjoyed exploring the neighborhood and testing out nearby restaurants by foot. The beds were very comfy, the shower was great, and there were lots of little extras that made the stay extra pleasant - the complimentary coffee was very appreciated and we absolutely loved that there was a cabinet of games for us to play after a long day on our feet. Everywhere we needed to go was a quick lyft ride away which made getting around easy and convenient. Thank you for the lovely stay! ",Chicago,1
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"I was in town for the NeoCon Conference and the Coach House was the perfect escape from all the busy at the end of my photoshoot. I traveled with my mom and my kids and we were comfortable, delighted, and fell in love with the area. Walking to the many parks nearby, and to Taylor St for dinner and dessert - we even found a bit of our personal family history as 3 generations ago our family lived in the same area.

Ken was a fantastic communicator and the small touches throughout the Coach House made our stay so easy and seamless. 

We can't wait to return!",Chicago,1
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"Top-notch guest house—loved it! Can’t say enough about the inviting decor, super-comfy beds (two well-appointed private bedrooms each with nice closet space, art, bedding and lighting), lovely and comfortable living and dining room areas, and fully-equipped kitchen with little extras (oils, seasonings, etc.) to help you if cooking.  Located in charming neighborhood just a few minute’s walk from Taylor St. (Little Italy), where we ate at four different places during our 4-day stay. Convenient and delicious options so close to home. And you will feel at home there! The Pink Line is just a few blocks away and offers excellent access to the city so you can just park the car for your visit (plenty of street parking but be comfortable parallel-parking just in case needed). The beautiful, modern guest house is thoughtfully set up for guests with everything including light switches labeled...instructions next to all appliances...plenty of cooking supplies and (Website hidden by Airbnb) conditioning...toiletries and comfy towels...plus plenty of visitor info and personal travel recommendations from the host. We appreciated the CTA cards left by other guests and left value on a few for the next guests as well. Loved the security features and felt very comfortable walking about though as in all areas of the city, you should use good street sense if venturing very far on foot. We did walk to the Jewel grocery store—which was an easy distance though I would be cautious doing so after dark (as you would do anywhere in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) special concerns). It was lovely to begin the day with morning coffee in the darling courtyard space (espresso and/or coffee, tea, cream and misc. snacks provided—thanks, Ken). I hope to stay at this wonderful guest house again and highly recommend it.",Chicago,1
Polk Street Coach House Apartment in Little Italy,"Ken and Curt’s place is perfect; a home away from home. We loved all the extra touches — great art and stylish space, snacks and nespresso, a booklet full of Chicago suggestions, extra Ventra cards, and even classical music playing upon our arrival! Their hospitality made this one of our favorite Airbnb experiences. Their place is also close to the pink and blue lines making it really easy to travel downtown. We did Uber Pool a couple of times and it cost anywhere between $5-$7 one way to get downtown. We were in the city to see Hamilton, but also went to the Art Institute Chicago and ate dinner at the Blue Door. Their place was easy to travel to between all those places. They also had great suggestions for places to eat in their neighborhood. We went to Sweet Maple and Stax for breakfast and Rosebud for dinner one night. All in all, such a great experience!",Chicago,1
"Private bed/bath in modern, spacious, clean condo","Nathan is an incredibly gracious host. He provides what you need, and goes beyond other hosts. For example, the extra towels and linen are things I like to frequently change, and to my surprise he had plenty for me to utilize. I fell in love with the City and my stay in this prime location are part of why my experience was perfect. Nathan made me feel at home, I think that's the greatest compliment I can give someone after staying several days. Did I mention, Nathan's place is bad ass? Haha, seriously. Wrigley field is minutes away, along with amazing restaurants and coffee shops!",Chicago,1
Private room & bathroom in Logan Square,"Our stay at Derek and Linda's place was amazing. Though we had an early check in, the rooms were speck free, clean and ready. Linda was so warm and also helped us with our bags. The photos of this place do not do justice to how lovely, warm and full of thoughtful touches it is. A big plus for me was the private washroom which was not only sparkling clean and extremely spacious but also full of all amenities one would need. And ofcourse, how can I not mention about the cutest, warmest cat I've ever met and that's Sir Dumpling! He is so adorable and I had a lovely time playing with him even though I am not an animal lover and a little paranoid around pets. To sum it up,  the place felt like home and we would love to come and stay here whenever we are back at Chicago :)",Chicago,1
SHARED Artist Loft . Very Unique,"Our stay at Michael’s was incredible! We had high expectations for the unique artist loft and location and everything was surpassed. The space is amazing—we loved our loft and the views from the apartment. Michael is so creative, hospitable, and a natural host. Everything we needed was provided and made for a very comfortable stay. He kindly offered for us to use his washer/dryer in unit, hold our bags after checkout until we headed out of the city, and of course gave us many recommendations and fun Chicago facts. Thank you, Michael! We can’t wait to return.",Chicago,1
SHARED Artist Loft . Very Unique,"Michael's place is one in a million! If you're on the fence, I highly recommend you make the booking - you won't regret it. The house is even better than the pictures show, and the rooftop deck is out of this world. It's location is the perfect launching pad for both daytime exploring and evening shenanigans - all while nestled under some very tall and expensive looking buildings. It's like staying at the house in the movie 'Up' - such a blast! Plus, Michael is a wonderful, engaging host who will make you feel at ease during your stay. He loves Chicago, and I do now, too! Cheers",Chicago,1
SHARED Artist Loft . Very Unique,"This beautiful loft was much bigger in person and everything about this space exceeded our expectations. I believe Michael went above & beyond and his place felt like home because he really cares for every detail. I loved the conversations, the local guidance + navigation skills, and the music. His taste in music was awesome, he woke up and started his day positive and that vibe rubbed off on all of us. My son is 6 and this was the perfect rental for his age. He liked to be out with the flowers on the rooftop. The outdoor roof is what blew our minds! This location is a prime spot for everything you need. We walked everywhere and parked our car in the sterling garage a block behind our building. Book in advance because it’s perfect and stay for at least two days!!",Chicago,1
SHARED Artist Loft . Very Unique,"This was, to me, the ideal Airbnb experience.    The space is amazing, with beautiful light, intriguing details, and of course a deck of flowers and Prairie grass that is just glorious.  I loved the loft room with its lovely linens, comfy bed, sitting area and welcoming morning light.  The bathroom is fantastic...and filled with every little amenity you could ever need.  Plus a nice heap of gorgeous thick towels.  I was only there one night....but it was so so refreshing.  Michael is truly a warm and thoughtful host and one who is happy to converse with his guests.  And he does make the best cup of coffee!  I will absolutely be returning to have another relaxing stay and see the new additions/changes that have been made to this ever evolving space.",Chicago,1
SHARED Artist Loft . Very Unique,"Hosts don't get much more welcoming than Michael! He makes you feel right at home straight away. Upon arriving he immediately offered me a drink, we sat and chatted for a while and then he kindly left me to do my own thing. His place is really quirky. It might not be for everyone, but I loved it! Being a loft apartment, the bedroom isn't the most private but it was fine for me. Overall I'd say the apartment is perfect for people traveling on their own or in couples.

His flamboyant rooftop is certainly a highlight of the place, especially if the weather is good. One of the most memorable moments of my trip was sitting out on the rooftop with a very friendly couple who were also staying with Michael through airbnb. We sat out there until the early hours with a couple of beers and enjoyed a great conversation. Michael even came to join us for a while.

The location is fantastic. The apartment is very central and in one of the most popular parts of town. The down side to that is that the apartment building is right next to a night club, so if you're staying over the weekend you'll hear all the music through the wall as well as the people down on the street (Chicagoans love honking their horns at all hours of the day/night ?!). Michael offers some ear plugs though, so unless you're a light sleeper you should be okay.

All in all, I really enjoyed my stay and I'd happily return. Thanks, Michael!",Chicago,1
SHARED Artist Loft . Very Unique,"This place is PHENOMENAL!!! Words can't describe how lovely having a glass of wine on the patio in bloom is while surrounded by the incredible sights and sounds of the city! We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedrooms listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cute and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable beds. The amenities provided were out of control, anything you could possibly need is probably there for you (did you forget a toothbrush? razor? floss? not to worry! it's there!)! Definitely the best airbnb experience I have had to date and I hope we can stay there again! Thanks Michael!!",Chicago,1
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"Michael thinks of everything, anticipating his guests' every need. He even had extra tooth brushes, so a forgetful old man (me) would have one. His spacious loft is furnished with lovely vintage items, including many of his own works, all arranged in a pleasing, artful fashion. In addition to being a great host, Michael is a wonderful human being and delightful raconteur. We had coffee with him both mornings of our stay, and by the second day he was already like family. Hope we can stay with him again. If you're going to be in or around the loop, the location is perfect, and the price is a bargain. He also directed up to a website that gave us a parking garage just three minutes' walk away that was only $20 for 24 hours. Unbelievable!",Chicago,1
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"Fantastic place with many beautiful and funny details. There is loads of artwork and antiques. I especially loved all the different kinds of lamps and the green plants. The neighborhood is buzzing. The loft is very close to Downtown and major sights with easy acces to public transportation. There are many delicious restaurants around the corner. Anyway, you won’t be disturbed in the loft - t’s quite and peaceful up here. The host is very nice and helpful. I loved to stay here, slept well and had good chats with the host. The perfect place. Highly recommend.",Chicago,1
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"Guys! This artist studio is magical! Pictures do not do it justice and the rooftop is a big kept secret; it blow your mind when you get there. Michael is an absolutely wonderful host; his work and art literature can be found spread all over the studio, it is quite inspiring. The place is nestled in a lovely block on River North practically unnoticed to the eye if you are not paying attention. For those that want a real cultural Chicago experience, this place is it. I am already booking my next trip and staying here. Book this place, you will probably want to move to Chicago.",Chicago,1
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"What can I say? Michael's place was just what I needed! I loved the sheets and the big bed was super cozy and comfy! Having privacy in the bedroom was great and having the bathroom in the there was such a nice touch. I loved the location!  It was close to everything and I was seeing Hamilton the night I stayed there. It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes. The morning I was checking out, I had the chance to sit and chat with Michael on my way out while he prepared for his next guest. What a great, down to earth, knowledgable, compassionate adventure seeker Michael is...I loved the stories he had about the artistic and eccentric atmosphere that his  loft had to offer! I will be back and hope to talk with him again~share stories and learn about new things and places I hadn't known about before! Thank you a million times over Michael!!!",Chicago,1
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"Michael is fantastic. He was welcoming, warm, and generous when we stayed with him this past Friday. We loved our cozy room, the art and decor was so unique, the location was perfect, and the rooftop patio was a great bonus. It’s probably even better in the warmer months, as we saw Michael’s seed collection laid out for spring planting, but we still enjoyed it! Michael even gave us his wool blanket for the baseball game we attended— very thoughtful and kind. We would love to stay here again someday!",Chicago,1
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"We absolutely loved  Michael’s place. 
The very huge Loft is artistically and tastefully furnished. The wide roofgarden filled with a hundred of flowerpots is the best location during breakfast and evening hang out . We ate breakfast there (when it didn’t rain)and drink wine on the  Sofa like an extended living room under the moonlight during evening with fantastic sound of Michael’s music collection . From the roof top you can see the numerous restaurants and bars around , but Michael‘s rooftop offers the best location , so why still going to a bar? 
We had fun and laughed a lot with Michael especially when we ate and had drinks together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . He is a very cool , accommodating and friendly person.Likewise his son Todd  who lives on the third floor helped us on our arrival carry up our heavy luggage , and Michael got up so early to help us carry down our suitcase on our departure day. 
Sorry for that Michael . 
Should we come to visit Chicago again sometime , we definitely will stay again in his place. And by the way those new 4 recently refurbished rooms are so beautiful with individual bathrooms ; high ceilings and have an early 20th century style . 
It was a great pleasure to have stayed in your place Michael . We did enjoyed your company . See you again,,,",Chicago,1
Shared Artist Loft Own Private Room,"Michael has created an incredible green oasis in the city! He’s led an interesting life and the chance to chat was a real treat, and probably our favorite part of the stay! The apartment is lush and artsy; it’s got a real lived-in, make yourself at home feeling. We felt welcome right away, and it really did seem like a home away from home! The location was perfect for us, easy to walk to excellent coffee and eateries. Michael was generous in his hospitality and you can tell that renovating spaces is a true passion! Thanks for a lovely stay, Michael!",Chicago,1
Spacious condo with an entire floor to yourself!,"Joshua’s place is spacious and welcoming with a large bedroom, washroom and living space. We appreciated our host’s friendliness and he has an adorable puppy who is friendly and sweet  (the puppy is active at times so sometimes we could hear her playing about upstairs!). Joshua shared his tips with us and we loved his recommendation to try out “Uncommon ground”, a lovely restaurant across the street. We loved our time in Chicago and truly enjoyed our time at Joshua’s air bnb!! Thank you Joshua!!",Chicago,1
Stunning Retro Apartment in Andersonville,"Jim and Maxim are awesome hosts, I was blown away  I was blown away For my stay  it was my first time staying airbnb plus. I’m happy to say th i’m happy to say where very  comfortable and well rested.  So my mom first time using Airbnb with me  he was blown away on how good it was to be able to get a such a Nich place.   So you guys are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe .  I know  past experiences  that Airbnb have change my life on how I stay in a city or a place of my travels keep up the good work.  So your place very  amazing  it’s worth every penny that I spend. I know that the  Quality  That I got can’t beat it in a hotel even a  Waldorf Astoria.  I will definitely come back and stay with you guys .  I really loved everything, I can’t describe how thankful and greatf for you both.   So you’re really a light in my stay and I would not able to this without you guy’s.  Thanks again!!!!!",Chicago,1
Stunning Retro Apartment in Andersonville,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.  
The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days! 
Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing. 
Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",Chicago,1

The Chic Bunk * Free parking Near CTA/Airport/Loop,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",Chicago,1
The Sprocket in Logan Square:Our Home is Your Home,Gin and her family was very welcoming and friendly with their hospitality. Location is in a very safe quite neighbourhood. Can walk around late at night without problem. Room was super clean and comfortable bed. Bathroom was awesome clean with all shower products provided. Big super plus bonus if your a dog lover . Their dog Meatball is very friendly and will keep you company if you want it.  Overall one of the best Airbnb experience I have to date and will book again when I come back to Chicago.,Chicago,1
The Sprocket in Logan Square:Our Home is Your Home,"Nice private room, with a firm/squeaky bed. (Just like the description!) beautiful house, in a nice neighbourhood. Gin and Michael offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! It was quite warm when we were there and the AC in the room was great. Meatball is the cutest (loudest) house greeter ever, we love him! He is very enthusiastic for cuddles, and so sweet! Quick and easy access to downtown, via or the pubs/restaurants of the area via train, or bus. Nice map of the neighbourhood in the room. There is so much to see and do in Chicago, stay a while! We have to come back and explore some more, and we would definitely stay at Gin’s again! :) Thanks again!",Chicago,1
"Unwind in the Bath at a Hip, Historic Coach House","The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",Chicago,1
"“Treetop"" Private Bedroom Bath w/ Breakfast","Dan and Traci's place was a wonderful place to stay while visiting Berkeley.  The room is cozy and gorgeous.  It is snug for two, but we were comfortable; all the built ins and storage nooks and charging corners made it a pleasure, and the view is unparalleled.  Plus there's the adjacent sitting room for extra space.  The bathroom is gorgeous; a huge skylight overlooking the city, and lovely custom tiled shower.  Traci is a professional chef, and she leaves out breakfast options that make 'continental' blush.  The deck, patio and yard are lush and inviting; I wish we'd had more time to sit and enjoy.  They had a couple of bikes for us to use, which made getting around town easy and enjoyable.  We got in quite late from the airport, and had no trouble checking in.  They're often around for suggestions, recommendations, and local knowledge.  I would have liked to stay longer!  We will definitely go back when next in town.",Oakland,1
"“Treetop"" Private Bedroom Bath w/ Breakfast","Treetops is a lovely space, with great natural light from windows and a skylight in the bathroom.  The sitting room extends the space, with a small desk and a sofa for relaxed chatting.  The bed is super soft and comfy, with a pretty quilt for extra warmth.  The thoughtful provision of soaps, shampoo, tissues, coffee, water, teas are terrific.  Plenty of towels, laundry service is included.  It's on the second floor, so there is a short flight of stairs, plus a few steps up to the private bathroom.  Clean, pleasant.  And the breakfast room and attached balcony are sunny, with Traci's homemade muffins, quiche, eggs, fruit.",Oakland,1
A Farm in Berkeley,"This is the most beautiful, magical little garden cabin in the middle of an urban farm. We loved everything about it. Very clean, with a comfortable, cozy bed, welcoming amenities, very quiet and private, nice areas for sitting inside and out. The gardens are amazing, with bright beautiful flowers and trees as the view out each window. Sequoiah was a gem - present, helpful and she gave us some good local tips. A real plus for us was the outdoor shower in the greenhouse. What a delight to be in a private area, yet still feel part of nature. The shower is hot, the towels fluffy and warm. We also love the compost toilet.....very easy to use, hygienic, no odor and very ecological. Don’t let this put you off! Sequoiah, you have created such a special place! We’ll definitely return!",Oakland,1
Charming 100 year old California bungalow,"We absolutely loved staying with Ralph and Laura! The place was so clean and comfortable - it really did feel like a home away from home. The property was easy to find, and Ralph and Laura greeted us as we got there. They had banana bread sitting on the counter when we arrived (which may have been the best banana bread I've ever had in my life). Since we were there on a week-long work trip in which we stayed at four different cities, it was so great to have a washer and dryer to clean our clothes before our long trip back home. They also have the coolest book where you can take a photo of yourself and write about your travels - so it was really neat to look through it and see all of the people who had stayed with them before us. Their property is located super close (like, 2 miles) to a great downtown-ish area with a theater, restaurants, and an awesome bookstore. We will definitely be staying with Ralph and Laura again when we are in the area. We definitely recommend!",Oakland,1
Charming 100 year old California bungalow,"Laura and Ralph are the most gracious of hosts. Upon our arrival they greeted us with bright smiles and delicious home baked banana bread. The posted photos don't do their cozy space justice. It's spacious, impeccably clean, well-organized, and full of thoughtful touches that may it feel like you're staying with family. They're keen to improve the stay of every guest (though I don't know how they could raise the bar any further) and respond immediately to any questions. Their backyard garden is lushly green, fragrant with blooms,   and beyond relaxing. We loved our stay and only wish that we've been able to stay longer!",Oakland,1
Charming private studio in prime location,"We stayed at Ron and Laurie’s place when we were helping with day care for our granddaughter in the area. Ron greeted us warmly, showed us around,, and made us feel very welcome! Their place was really lovely with many special touches!  Some of those special touches included fresh flowers,  fresh ground coffee, homemade granola and containers of Greek yogurt for breakfast, evening snacks (cookies and tea), and a lovely patio,  The location was GREAT — a block from the 4th Street area in Berkeley, where we always enjoy spending time at our visits to Berkeley.  They clearly labeled items as to their location and how various things worked.  We will definitely stay here again when we return to the East Bay",Oakland,1
Charming private studio in prime location,"We loved our stay at Ron & Laurie's place! We wish we'd had more time to enjoy the adorable back yard.  They thought of everything! So many nice touches like Laurie's homemade granola,  Desperation Snacking Noodles (free ramen with beautiful bowls to eat out of),  great coffee and tea selections, desk with great view of backyard, nice selection of books (if you have time for reading), lots of bathroom essentials (loved having the makeup/face wipes and hand lotion) and everything was so clean and bright! We would definitely stay here again!",Oakland,1
"Chic European Style Guest Suite, #3","Ben and Mike’s air bnb was prime location  - about a 15 min drive from the city with many restaurants and coffee (Philz included!) close by, which we loved. Target and many other stores are just 2 minutes away!

Their place itself was cleanly kept, cozy, and just the right amount of space for the two of us. Ben was extremely hospitable and even took the time to give us pointers and history about the Bay Area, which was very helpful especially since it was our first time visiting together. 

He also showed us their beautiful backyard which was lush and refreshing, and was able to take Instagram worthy pictures in the garden and pond.

We highly recommend Ben and Mike’s home. Thank you so much for hosting us!Hope we cross paths again!",Oakland,1
"Chic European Style Guest Suite, #3","Firstly Mike and Ben are possibly the best hosts I've ever had at an airbnb. They are amazing.  Ben gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tips so we loved that. They have thought of so many little touches I've rarely seen in airbnbs including bottles of water and bananas to get you started. 

Secondly the apartment is just fantastic.  It's large,  clean and really comfortable.  I saw a previous review about noise but we heard nothing at all. There's very little traffic and we never heard the other guests.  The location is great for getting into San Francisco and we found everything easy and accessible. 

Thank you so much for the stay! We would highly recommend staying here with the best hosts in town!",Oakland,1
Colorful Garden Flat five minute walk from BART,"What a perfect place to stay and be able to take the BART wherever we wanted to go. We first took it to the Oracle Arena to see the Elton John concert. Then the next day we went to downtown Berkeley, to the Farmer's Market and to the Berkeley campus. Then to San Francisco where we had lunch in China town and watched the Women's March on Market Street which was HUGE! The second evening we walked to dinner at a restaurant just a few blocks from the cottage. It is fun and funky and authentically eclectic. The artistic touches and the environmental concerns were a plus. We felt like we were guests of Mark and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. You don't need to bring or buy much. Just make yourself at home and do as much or as little as you want. We met Mark and Jenny at the end of our stay and they are a delightful couple that we hope to see again soon. Thanks so much Mark and Jenny.

Don and Pam",Oakland,1
Colorful Garden Flat five minute walk from BART,"We loved staying at Jenny's place! We were there a total of 5 nights, and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. It's a comfortable space in a very convenient location (quick walk to BART station) on a quiet street, and had everything we needed, and more, to make us feel right at home. We slept like logs in the extremely comfortable bed. The kitchen is well-equipped, and the thoughtful touches of eggs, English muffins, milk, coffee, etc., etc. meant that we were all set for breakfasts. Jenny & Mark are wonderful hosts, who were very quick to respond to messages. We'd love to stay there again. Highly recommend!",Oakland,1
Elmwood cottage,"Susan's cottage was perfect for the two of us during our visit in Berkeley. We loved exploring throughout the Elmwood neighbourhood, the Berkeley campus and nearby Rockridge. There was a great variety of shops and restaurants nearby - our favourite was a little hole-in-the-wall doughnut shop called Dream Fluff Donuts. The cottage is very quiet, clean and well equipped - everything is exactly as in the AirBnB pictures and description. Susan is very friendly and available if needed but is respectful of our privacy. We would not hesitate to return to the Elmwood cottage!",Oakland,1
Garden cottage in convenient Oakland location.,"Deanna’s little cottage is the perfect, cozy getaway! Located right outside of San Francisco, the traffic can get a little crazy and you have to be creative with your parking, but we loved the opportunity to experience the culture of Oakland! Deanna was a great host and the cottage was fully equipped with everything we needed for our stay— she even left a few tasty treats for us! We absolutely loved everything about it and Deanna was excellent with her communication and making sure we were fully taken care of.",Oakland,1
Garden cottage in convenient Oakland location.,"This is the best Airbnb place we have stayed at and we’ve stayed at a few. We were expecting it to be really good, but it was better! The photographs do not do it justice. This is a gorgeous place in a beautiful garden. It was spotlessly clean with plenty of towels provided as well as information about the local area, printer & PC, washing machine and dryer, large fridge and freezer and a well equipped kitchen. It was really near to local shops and restaurants and a beautiful park. Parking was never a problem. Waking up to fruit and baked treats made by Deanna was such a wonderful start to the day. 
We loved this place and can thoroughly recommend it.",Oakland,1
Lakeshore Cottage,"Hey Marie...Enjoyed our stay in your guest house. It was very clean, bright and inviting. We loved the delicious cherries, blackberries oranges and banana bread that was left for us to enjoy. Loved the little back yard oasis where our daughter enjoyed taking some amazing pictures. Thank you for letting us use your washer, dryer and the scale. We were so glad that we got to meet you, your husband Stan and your so called ‘naughty’ dog (which he was so not!). It was such a warm genuine welcome. Thank you again so much and we will definitely recommend your place for future stays...Tanya and Aaron Furuto 07.09.2018",Oakland,1
Little house in a Berkeley garden,"This was my 3rd visit to the little house and I'm already looking forward to my next visit!  Erica always goes above and beyond to make sure that each and every guest is comfortable - plus the extra touches are like nothing else I've ever experienced in an AirBnb!  For instance, she was so sweet to have brought me coffee and fresh bread each morning (even bringing out a hot cup of coffee one morning when it was pouring down rain!) and was constantly making sure that I had everything I needed. I'm so glad that I finally had a chance to meet her in person as she's absolutely lovely - thanks Erica for another wonderful trip and I'll see you next time!",Oakland,1
Luxury Casita in Rockridge Garden,"Diana was the ultimate host!  She was both friendly and professional.  Her timeliness when I thought I was locked out was also fantastic. 

I typically stay in the same hotel each time I visit the East Bay for work.  After this visit at Diana's guest house, I'm convinced that this experience was significantly better than any hotel I could stay in.  The scene was picturesque (imagine lemon trees, tropical flowers and humming birds each morning).  The actual guest room is even better in person than the beautiful pics online.  The house is so modern, spotless, and there was fruit, tea, chocolate and a bottle of wine waiting for me 

The one aspect that I thought I wouldn't adjust to was not having a television.  However, this ended up being something I loved.  This space is the perfect place to do deep reflection and be present in your thoughts.  I grew to really appreciate not having the distraction of a television.",Oakland,1
Magical Modern Cottage,"If you like to stay in places that are just as interesting to look at as to stay in, this is one you should check out.  If you like and appreciate thoughtful modern design, you need to stay here.  If you want a place that is peaceful and, to use the Airbnb descriptor - magical, you need to stay here.  We loved the modern design and really cool efficient use of space and the tranquil garden setting.  I just wish we were there when it was warmer and sunny so we could sit in the garden outside.  Colin was super quick in his communication and was there to greet us when we arrived.  This is a perfect hideaway with easy access to oakland and berkeley. Oh, and the bed was really comfortable - meant for sleeping in.   We were up visiting our son at Cal and it was just a quick 10 min drive over.  We can't wait for another time we can visit so we can stay here again!",Oakland,1
Modern Retro Private Studio,"I’ve been to the Bay Area dozens of times, but this place was a new experience for me.  The Berkeley Hills have lovely views of the bay, and the neighborhood has lots of cafes and restaurants.  Justin’s place is close to the one of the best restaurants in the world, as well as the “gourmet ghetto” of excellent and inexpensive food. 
The room was clean and cozy, very nicely decorated, a cool, mini apartment under the main house. The street was quiet, yet waking distance to amenities.  A great getaway for me and my friend. I’d highly recommend Justin’s place!",Oakland,1
Need an awesome space to crash?,"Christian and Jackie are lovely people who offer a warm welcome into their home. The littles extras such as coffee, homemade bread and jam and fruit was a lovely touch to making us feel comfortable in their home.  
We had the small bedroom off the kitchen area and the bed was so comfortable. There’s enough space to hang up your clothes, we didn’t need lots of space so the room size was perfect for us. 
A MUST is to catch the ferry from Oakland Ferry Port to San Francisco Bay Ferry Building or Pier 41. Great views of Oakland docks and a different view of San Francisco Bay including travelling under the Bay Bridge.  For a quick and easy way to travel into San Francisco is by the BART, the nearest stop is West Oakland. You can catch any train into San Francisco. 
I would recommend anyone looking for a warm and friendly household must stay at Christain and Jackie’s.",Oakland,1
Need an awesome space to crash?,"Christian's Airbnb was GREAT! He was a 10-minute walk from the West Oakland Bart station (one stop to downtown SF!) and the house was gorgeous - the photos definitely do not do it justice. The space was large and beautiful; you can tell Christian has many artistic bones in his body because the house is beautifully and boldly decorated (loved the art and the dinosaurs!). Not only that, but Christian is a foodie and an Oakland connoisseur, and he spent 20+ minutes talking to me about restaurants and local food recommendations. His wife also makes bread and they grow oranges in the backyard - what an awesome, hip couple. 

I could go on longer, but I'll just say that I had the best experience and the best sleep. Will definitely come back if I am ever in Oakland again! ",Oakland,1
Private Casita with Stunning View,I came to visit my daughter to celebrate a special occassion. I was looking simply for a place to rest at the end of the day. What I found at the casita was a beautiful spot with a million dollar view. Every detail was thoughtfully presented...from an oh-so-comfortable bed to great art; from starting me off with fresh fruit and english muffins to a deck overlooking the bay area; from lovely towels to a very pretty living room and kitchen. I didn’t need a car and easily used Lyft to get me anywhere I needed to go. The location is safe and beautifully landscaped. I can’t wait until my next Oakland visit and the chance to stay at the casita!!,Oakland,1
Private Casita with Stunning View,"My husband and I enjoyed every minute we spent in Melia's lovely casita!  This was our second trip to visit our son who now lives and works in San Francisco.  On our last trip we stayed in several hotels and dined out every night.  This time we wanted something more cost effective, more homey, and a kitchen to prepare meals.  I was so taken with the photos, description of Melia's casita, and reviews that I did not hesitate to book, even though it was across the bridge and would be a drive to SF. Our son was able to spend a few nights with us and we all enjoyed some home cooked meals....prepared with fresh herbs from Melia's garden!  The casita is small but has everything you could want for a comfortable stay.  Such care and thought went in to planning this accommodation...from kitchen supplies, to beds and linens, to the beautiful décor, to the luxurious pullout in the living room (my son loved it!), to the deck with a hammock and stunning (Website hidden by Airbnb) was all so appreciated. I could not get over the special little touches everywhere like plants, candles, and pictures.  I love to cook and had asked Melia for certain spices which she kindly, and without hesitation, supplied.  Communication from the beginning was outstanding, every single question I had was answered promptly and with additional helpful information.  In good traffic we could get to our son's place in SF in 25 minutes.  Double that in heavy traffic, but we did not mind because we loved this casita so much!  I am so glad we found you Melia!  It was wonderful and we thank you for everything.",Oakland,1
Private cottage in enclosed gardens,"This truly feels like slice of paradise. We could not have been happier with the accommodations! The garden is gorgeous - we loved picking fresh oranges and lemons! The cottage was immaculate, very comfortable, and had everything we needed. It felt very private, with plenty of sunlight from the skylights, even when the shades were drawn. Ben & Jacqueline have print-outs with a guide for your stay that is super helpful, especially their neighborhood recommendations! And the hot tub... what a treat. You will love staying here!",Oakland,1
Private cottage in enclosed gardens,"You can book this place with your eyes closed. Ben & Jacqueline created the cutest and most romantic place. Even though it’s quite far from downtown it’s definitely worth it. It’s definitely cheaper ( and better) than what you can find downtown. And with the money saved just Uber your way around ! 
Go home to a gorgeous and quiet garden, get into the hot tub after a long day of sightseeing ! 
The mega + was definitely all the stuff available in the house ( great choice of tea, coffees, towels, sugars, real cooking ustensiles etc.) in great quantities which really makes the accommodation very homey and generous.
Only down side : I can only sleep in the dark , sunlight comes through the windows in the morning so I was wide awake by sunrise. But to be honest i really didn’t mind as it was the perfect set for some morning coffee and reading. 
To sum up : we loved it !",Oakland,1
Private Room in Idyllic Craftsman,"I had a wonderful time at Christina's place. The description of the listing is very accurate, it really did feel like a retreat. I stayed 3 nights and would have loved to stay longer. The space was so cute, she is very thoughtful and creative with the decorations and lots of attention to detail to make the space as comfortable as possible for guests. She actually uses the room as a guest room for friends and family normally so this isn't some Airbnb where they slap together all their old and mismatched furniture and sheets. Bed was super comfortable, great pillows, slept wonderfully at night due to quiet atmosphere. It's a charming old house. Loved the garden. Fresh duck eggs from the backyard ducks were amazing and so nice and generous of her to share! It was also cool to see all her cooking and fermentation projects going on in the kitchen, as someone who is also passionate about that stuff it was fun to stay with someone else who loves to cook. Location is great if you have a car. Easy parking, close to airport and pretty close to everything else including some great hiking trails about 10 minutes away. My friend who lives in the area told me it is pretty close to a sketchy area so you might notice it as you drive through but you can tell the houses change and this neighborhood felt 100% safe, no concerns with safety. I would definitely like to stay here again next time I return to the Bay Area. Feels like a cozy home away from home ",Oakland,1
Spacious Private Garden Studio,"We really loved staying at Justin's place - perfect for our needs. Incredibly-well located near to the University campus, gourmet ghetto with its great choice of eateries, and the Rose Garden and hills above. A lovely part of Berkeley, with beautiful gardens all around and the street is incredibly quiet so you can get a good night's rest. The apartment itself worked beautifully for our three-day stay - the bed is huge and comfortable, the shower powerful, a cupboard to put our clothes (rare in our experience) and fridge/coffee-maker/kettle/crockery so we could have breakfast at home. Justin is really friendly and accommodating too. The icing on the cake for us was that the apartment looks out onto a green area that made it very light and private - and we saw a deer right outside the door! Highly recommended.",Oakland,1
Super Spacious Bright Happy Home,"My wife and I recently spent two nights at Leslie's place in Berkeley, and enjoyed it a great deal.  While the home is a bit hidden from the street, when we walked through the gate we were immediately taken with the sweet fragrances of the beautiful flowers and plants in the front yard.  Although I wasn't sure from the home description, there are actually two small spaces to sit outside and enjoy the weather--on the front porch and on a bench in the front yard.

The home itself has lots of charm and is nicely decorated throughout.  The large open living/dining area is a great place to relax.  While the small TV is viewable only from the formal dining table, it worked fine for us when watching a bit of TV in the evening.

The kitchen is spacious and fully equipped with plenty of counter space and everything needed to prepare a few meals.  Leslie has obviously gone out of her way to make sure everything is well-labeled which makes finding things much easier in the kitchen and throughout the home!  The informal dining table in the kitchen worked well for us when dining at home.

The bedroom with queen bed and bathroom/shower were all on the cozy side, but the two of us managed just fine.  The queen bed was quite firm but also comfortable, and we slept great.

The home is located on a quiet residential street, and the location is fantastic for exploring Berkeley.  While we found it too far to walk down to the waterfront, we were able to explore the whole downtown and university area on foot.  BTW, although a lot of the restaurants were closed when we went out for dinner (Monday night), we fell in love with the patio area at Jupiter and their salads were amazing.

All in all, Leslie's space was a great choice for us from which to explore Berkeley, and Leslie has done a great job creating a very livable and welcoming space for guests!",Oakland,1
The Cottage at Squirrel End,"Linda and Dan's cottage is the perfect place to relax after the hustle and bustle of a jam packed vacation.  It was wonderful to have full privacy while maintaining precious views of the beauty of nature right outside the windows.  My husband and I were inspired by this space, with its simplicity and aesthetic. The bathroom is to die for, and we did not take the claw foot tub for granted.  Affordable, lovely, and relaxing.  The hosts were attentive and kind.  We will most definitely return if we are ever in the Bay Area again.",Oakland,1
The Cottage at Squirrel End,"Dan and Linda’s small, secluded cottage was exactly what we needed to escape to at the end of a long, crazy wedding day! The bed and amenities were comfortable and clean, and they easily accommodated our later than usual check-in. Linda also provided us with all of our wedding flowers, and even brought some of our luggage over to the cottage for us after setting up at our venue! We loved the little bouquets beside the bed that matched our wedding florals - a lovely and thoughtful touch! Their hospitality really went above and beyond what was required or expected, and we felt like special guests in their beautiful home. Thank you!",Oakland,1
The Cottage at Squirrel End,"Apparently, Linda & Dan's place is popular with honeymooners and it is easy to see why.  It is charming and feels like everything about the space has been done with thought and grace.  I loved the cast iron tub in the bathroom, near the stand-alone shower, and the light from the discreetly placed windows. The entrance path and outside sitting area surrounded by tall bamboos added to the charm.  We coincidentally ran into Dan and Linda on the street outside the cottage and they were informative and charming.  This is a place I would return to in a minute.",Oakland,1
Vintage Time Capsule,"We were in town for a wedding that was located near by.  It was myself, my husband and our 5 year old son. We are so glad we ditched the idea of staying in a hotel. Michael & Capra’s airstream was such a unique experience. Our son absolutely loved it. The trampoline was a huge hit. And he was obsessed with their sweet cats, who were very friendly. He even had the chance to have a quick play date with their daughter (free babysitting! Ha!). It rained the majority of our weekend, which made our nights even more special. I still can hear the raindrops on the outside of the airstream. So relaxing, and cozy! Highly recommend. Such a sweet little place.",Oakland,1
"Visit San Francisco, Stay on Alameda Island","My husband and I were very impressed with Lia and Gregg’s gracious hospitality and comfortable, clean apt.!!  And, we LOVED their sweet doggie, Questa!  She couldn’t be more friendly and polite!  
The location of their apt is perfect for easy access to and from Oakland Airport and great access to Oakland and San Francisco.  The ferry stops in Alameda to take you to San Francisco, as well!
Alameda itself has lovely character and a great variety of restaurants and shops with a small town feel!
We definitely recommend staying with Lia and Gregg in their sunny, cozy, clean apt. and benefit from their great personalities and hospitality!",Oakland,1
Wooded In-Law,"Too bad there isn't a 6 stars rating because our stay was just that great! George & Colleen's place was super comfortable, sparkling clean, stylishly decorated and spacious for our family of 3. There is a cute backyard and our preschool son loved roasting marshmallows in the fire pit! Lots of love and details were put into this 'cottage'. The bed and linens are top quality and we were delighted to find a welcome basket of healthy food waiting for us! We booked 1 week and had no issues, communication was excellent (George is very friendly and cheerful. He was always available when needed). We've stayed in over 2 dozen airbnbs around the world and this is definitely one of our BEST experiences! Thank you again George & Colleen for hosting us.",Oakland,1
Wooded In-Law,"Oakland - Myself and my boyfriend absolutely loved our stay here in Oakland, we didn't want to leave. Very spacious, peaceful and quiet. Colleen and George were very helpful and always gave us space if we wanted. George very nicely baked up some blueberry muffins, ahh they were amazing I wish we could have some more now  All in all it was one of our favorite Air B&B's visting America.     We stayed far out from San Francisco City because the prices were so high, it depends on what you you want to do in the city. We don't regret booking our from the city. We would high recommend Colleen & George place in Oakland.",Oakland,1
Wooded In-Law,"Amazing location with amazing hosts! George & Colleen are so helpful and assisted us promptly whenever we needed help! The house was cosy and beautiful, & it’s so nicely decorated! Looks so much better in real life as compared to the photos! 
Requested for some fire log on our last night to set a little fire outside the house, and George was so fast in helping us to set it up after hearing our request, he even went ahead & hang some pretty lights outside for us, really makes us feel so happy!
Would love to stay at George & Colleen’s place again if we have the chance to!",Oakland,1
Bikes Beach Gear and Fun Spacious and Comfy Ocean View Room Walk to Pier,"Scott is a great host who has gone above and beyond to create a great experience for his guests.  From step by step guides to local grocery stores and eateries to towel warmers and LED lights Scott has thought of every detail that will provide a wonderful experience for his guests.  Having stayed just short of three weeks, I most appreciated the gourmet kitchen as I could cook some meals, the patio to enjoy some fresh air, and the fact that the beach was within walking distance of his home. As a working professional I also enjoyed the privacy and quietness that the room provided when a good nights sleep was needed. The ocean views did not hurt either!!  Overall Scott was very helpful and easy to communicate with.  He has a beautiful home that is everything pictured and more.  For those with cars, street parking is easily available.",Redondo Beach,1
Bikes Beach Gear and Fun Spacious and Comfy Ocean View Room Walk to Pier,"Scott’s place was perfect for my LA beach weekend getaway! He was out of town during my visit but none the less was a very attentive host who made sure to message me to ask me my arrival time, check in on me and leave me tips about using the houses many amenities.  That brings me to my 2nd point - the amenities at Scott’s were fantastic! Nice pool table, beautiful clean bathroom with lux feeling shower, the amazon echo was more helpful than I thought it would be and having access to a bike + all the beach gear (towels, beach chairs, etc) was an extra bonus.  Finally regarding the location you cant beat it. Not on the strand directly but more tucked away in a quiet secluded neighborhood walking distance to the Redondo pier and a Whole Foods/shopping plaza. I rode the bikes and it took me about 5-10 minutes to get to the beach.   Overall great value for the cost and beautiful place. If I’m ever in LA again and not staying with my in-laws I would definitely stay at his place again.",Redondo Beach,1
Bikes Beach Gear and Fun Spacious and Comfy Ocean View Room Walk to Pier,"We had a fantastic stay at Scott’s house. The room was impeccably clean and comfortable, and we were impressed by Scott’s thoughtful attention to detail, including a towel warmer, welcome snacks, in-room coffee maker, and every toiletry you could think of in the bathroom! We especially liked Scott’s beautiful terrace in the morning, where we could watch humming birds while enjoying a cup of coffee. Scott was very hospitable and friendly, and made us feel right at home. Overall a 5-star experience! ",Redondo Beach,1
Breezy Cottage One Block from the Beach,"I love this place. It is super close to everything (beach, restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, library, post office, LAX). Tiana is super helpful with restarant suggestions, etc., and she is very quick to respond. The actual place is so cute and clean, and decorated in a beach theme. There is a brand new grill outside with a table (with umbrella) and chair setup . There are bicycles, a beach wagon, beach chairs, beach umbrellas in the shed outside. I cannot say enough about this place. You will love it!!!",Redondo Beach,1
Breezy Cottage One Block from the Beach,"Sparking clean, bright and fresh. The cottage is well appointed and efficient. I felt like I had all the privacy I needed and wanted (including a private entrance and dedicated parking spot on a quiet alley), but also felt safely tucked into a neighborhood, surrounded by homes. Traveling alone, that was very welcome.   For me, proximity to the beach and within walking distance to a vibrant commercial district w/ cafes and restaurants was the best.",Redondo Beach,1
Breezy Cottage One Block from the Beach,"Tiana was an amazing host. She was so prompt to response to our text messages and was such a sweetheart— so willing to go above and beyond to make us comfortable & or experience worth the stay.  The cottage house was THEE MOST CUTEST, most COMFORTABLE, and ADORABLE thing EVER. I was SOOOOO in love with everything even the little backyard area.  This is a phenomenal place to stay. I’d highly recommend it to anyone who’s in town or just wants to a weekend to relax, plus you’re close to the beach ",Redondo Beach,1
Breezy Cottage One Block from the Beach,"This is one of the best properties we've stayed in for a few reasons: great location, value, quality of space and amenities provided.  We are a family of 4 and the guesthouse offers enough space to sleep us all with parking and a small outdoor space to enjoy the coastal breezes.    Not only is the location fantastic (1 block to the beach) but it is so nice to enjoy a property that is completely ready to go! All the beach gear you need (bikes, boards, chairs, towels, toys - everything!) and a very well stocked kitchen (cooking oils, seasonings,  gadgets, etc).   This all made our stay exceptionally easy and Tiana was wonderful to work with!  Awesome property!",Redondo Beach,1
Breezy Cottage One Block from the Beach,"Tiana's Beach Cottage is a prime example of why people are choosing Air B&B over traditional hotels. The location is unbeatable for Southern California; in the middle of everything you'll want to go see, but off the beaten path where you can really just take in the Beach sights and smells to ease your stress away.   The access to and from the space is great, with private off-road parking and a  dedicated entry-way for guests. Compared to a $25 a night packed parking lot or tipped Valet where you'll still need to walk a good distance and then take an elevator to get to your room, the convenience of this can't be overstated for travelers.  The space itself is so homey feeling that you'll likely find yourself wanting to just hang out around the house. It's so clean and bright that you're likely never going to have that common feeling many of us have in hotels where we feel like we need to spray them down with disinfectant to keep our skin from crawling. It's intelligently staged with nice amenities that come in helpful, and she's thought of everything a beach traveler might need. Tiana has a great team that takes care of the space, is nearby if you need assistance, and will provide everything you could ever need. It sleeps 4 well. The beds are comfortable. And the shower pressure is fantastic!  The living structure they've created for travelers is very special, but the location is really what makes this place a gem. Redondo is a safe, quiet and clean little community with a great beach and pier, that's about a 30-45 minute drive from everything in the greater LA area. The walk to the beach takes one minute, and the walk for fantastic fast food is literally 30 seconds away! The El Burrito Jr. food stand just down the alley had some of the best Mexican food we've ever had, and the Donut shop across the street had donuts to die for!  As a host, Tiana is second to none. So far we've run into nothing but good people in our Air B&B travels, but Tiana stands out for certain.  Her communication is so friendly and helpful that she really made our stay even more memorable. I don't think it was special treatment, I believe this is her standard mode of operation and it equates to high level customer service. The service we receive can either enhance or detract from a travelers experience, but Tiana's attentiveness made the entire package truly unbeatable.   If you're planning to go to Southern California, do yourself a favor a book some time in Tiana's space. We booked 3 different locations on our 8 day vacation in California; One in La Jolla, one in Anaheim, and this one, but we probably should've spent the entire time in Redondo as the home base. It's a pretty special place...Jump on it if it's available!",Redondo Beach,1
Breezy Cottage One Block from the Beach,"Such a great stay at Tiana's cottage!  It is perfectly clean, comfortable, and walking distance to the beach. Everything we needed for the beach was thoughtfully provided, chairs, towels, cooler bags, making the daily trips a breeze. Tiana herself was also incredible. She was very welcoming, accommodating, and patient throughout our entire stay.  I would 100% recommend staying here!",Redondo Beach,1
Breezy Cottage One Block from the Beach,"Wow- we have used Airbnb so many times but this was by far our best experience!  The “ plus” exceeded our expectations.  The little extra touches made all the difference and I am not sure I could ever go back to a standard.  The host was on top of communication with a welcome, check in and even recommendations based on our preferences.  The location was just as described! We were able to walk to the beach restaurants and she even provided some great locations we would not have found on our own.  In house there was coffee, popcorn and bathroom items we have not had in standard Airbnb locations.    We appreciated all of the extra touches and would book again in a heartbeat! This host is one you should not pass up!",Redondo Beach,1
Breezy Cottage One Block from the Beach,"We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. Our host went the extra mile by checking in with us every day to see if we needed anything, and she was more than willing to do whatever it took to ensure us an outstanding stay. The extra amenities (beach wagon, boogie boards, sand toys, beach chairs, etc.) helped our beach excursions go off without a hitch. The cottage is bright and cheery, and quite well-appointed, and the bedding is super comfortable! We were surprised by the high-quality air mattresses that allowed all of us to get a great night's sleep. We highly recommend staying at T's beach cottage. We can't wait to come back again!",Redondo Beach,1
Bungalow by Beach with Casper Mattress & Free Parking,"Angelas place was one of the best Airbnb experiences EVER! She was such a wonderful host and greeted us when we arrived ( added bonus: with her adorable puppy Bailey). Her place was super clean and so beautiful, especially the back yard with the gorgeous orange tree and a fire pit to light up on a chilly night. I have never seen a more thoughtful host, she had everything available for a comfortable stay. She even light candles and turned in twinkling lights for us in the back yard in the every evening. She has put so much care into every single detail and created a wonderful experience. She also had a lot of recommendations for dining and activities to do around the city. We cannot recommend her place enough. Thank you Angela for such an awesome stay in LA.",Redondo Beach,1
Bungalow by Beach with Casper Mattress & Free Parking,"In my three years of experience with Airbnb, staying at Angela’s place is bar none the best experience I’ve ever had with an Airbnb listing.  Angela and her cozy oasis truly surpassed all of my expectations. After sharing with her the reason for my stay, she completely went out of her way to think of every detail and amenity that I needed to feel comforted and at home.  I now clearly know the reason why she has the ratings that she does, and why her place is booked so far out in advance.  Every element, from the spa-like goodies to soy candles, was tastefully curated by function and design. If you’re looking for a calm, serene, and intimate experience -- choose this place. What you don’t see on this listing is photos of her modern and inviting outdoor patio space. It was perfect for reading, reflecting, and journaling. It’s also covered in twinkle lights and candles, so you can get a bit of starry night magic even if it’s cloudy (which was my case).  This was truly an impeccable experience and Angela was so warm and gracious. At the mention of my slight fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it. If you have a chance to meet her and her sweet pup Bailey you’ll instantly be at ease. Personally, I can't wait to come back and stay again!",Redondo Beach,1
Bungalow by Beach with Casper Mattress & Free Parking,"I’m fairly certain that Angela is part angel. We arrived late on a Sunday night, about an hour later than planned due to a delayed flight. We were just married and are taking our honeymoon in a few months, so we stopped here for a “mini-moon”. Angela had ready for us a cheese plate, some sparkling wine, and chocolates! She also rented a pair of nice bikes to us for free!   The cabin is small, but Angela has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay. There’s even a fenced in patio to enjoy the sun during the day or a small fire at night.   Angela made sure we were fully equipped to have a fun and relaxing few days, and at the same time made a point to give us privacy. Couldn’t have asked for a better Airbnb or a kinder host. Thanks again, Angela!",Redondo Beach,1
Bungalow by Beach with Casper Mattress & Free Parking,"We planned our first Airbnb experience very carefully and well in advance of a family wedding in Redondo Beach.  To say that we have been pleased with the outcome is very much an understatement.  Angela is a gracious, thoughtful, and meticulous host, and her accommodations reflect this.  It’s obvious that considerable attention to detail went into arranging the cute, efficient, well appointed interior, with the serene, calming outdoor spaces adding a somewhat unexpected slice of nature for a sensory delight.  The living room/bedroom has all the necessary comforts, with a sofa and ample room for clothing and other travel goods.  The bed is very comfortable and sleeps two adults with ease.  We made good use of the stove and other kitchen amenities.  The bathroom is clean and bright with a strong, rejuvenating shower. A most remarkable aspect of our stay was the surprisingly numerous items that are available for use, from makeup mirror to the fantastic 3-speed cruiser bicycles, that made our stay so much easier and more pleasant.  If you happen to leave something behind, there’s an excellent chance Angela already has it stocked in her place.  Consequently, we simply cannot recommend this Airbnb any higher.  It’s a great value and we’ll definitely be taking advantage once again the next time we’re in Redondo Beach!",Redondo Beach,1
Home Away from Home in Hermosa Beach,"Omg! I cannot talk highly enough of the place and the hosts! What an incredible find.... I almost don’t want to share it so it will be available again for me next time... I will definitely be back. A day walking along the beach path, or a really long bike ride,or an easy hour walk to the shopping mall..... the restaurants and grocery stores are so close and the comedy club right on the doorstep in walking distance ....the BEST place! The little touches like sticky tape, and scissors, even down to great clothes hangers that have material so your clothes stay on them!   Wonderful experience and such great hosts! I will definitely be missing not only the great place but the beautiful people as well!",Redondo Beach,1
Petite Boutique,"The absolute best AirBNB/hotel experience I’ve ever had. The place is beautiful. It is small - but a perfect size for one person or a couple. It has everything you need to be comfortable and feels so cozy. I even had a chance to share coffee on the back patio with Jesse (who is the sweetest dog I’ve ever encountered) and Neva (our host) one morning and it totally made the trip that much more memorable. It’s always great to encounter good people.   The place is walking distance to many delicious restaurants, bars and even the beach path.   I have zero complaints and hope to be able to stay here again.",Redondo Beach,1
Petite Boutique,Cutest and well behaved puppy that is sometimes chilling in the back. Room was super cozy and felt like a cottage. She accommodated our arrival and departure time cuz we came early and left late. My first time using air b&b and i am completely satisfied,Redondo Beach,1
Petite Boutique,"Amazing, amazing amazing! We were so happy when we arrived.  We felt at peace, happy, and safe. We briefly met Neva when arriving, she is friendly and nice. Her dog Logan is a very cute, friendly and well behaved dog! The place had a nice cooling unit, and the room felt so big and comfy, the rain  shower felt awesome and the patio is beautiful and nice to hang out on. Only a few minute drive to the beach. You really could walk to a lot of places or to anything you would need even a grocery store.  Good food close by too. Thanks again, Neva! Hope to come back next time we're in So. Cal",Redondo Beach,1
"Private Guest House, parking, 24 hr access, beach","Paul's place was even better than we expected. I knew it was going to be a great home from the sterling reviews, but I was still surprised to find this stylish space that is equipped with every little essentials left there by a very thoughtful host. Check-in instructions were easy to follow. Paul greeted us with a warm welcome and he made sure we had absolutely everything we needed.  The space is furnished and decorated beautifully. It is filled with natural light and ocean air.  While we were settling in, a couple of furry friends came and said hello to us and that put us in such a great mood. We were there to enjoy the beach as much as we could, and Paul made sure we had everything we desired for our beach excursions. He even brought us ice packs and tray so we can pack up the cooler.  We found beach towels, chairs and toys. He offered us an umbrella as well, but we had brought ours. Bikes were also left there for us, but we couldn't utilize them in the end. After a long day at the beach, we were able to wash away our day in the oversized  shower (loved the shower so much!) and watch movies and relax on the bed and the couch (also turns into a full size bed) with our kids.  Check-out was equally as easy as check-in, we just had a really hard time saying good bye to the place. We would love to visit again in the near future. <3 ",Redondo Beach,1
"Charming Garden Apartment, Steps From The Beach","Don't overlook this cozy little apartment by the ocean--this place is a gem! Heather really made us feel welcome in her beautiful in-law apartment with a lush garden out back to sit and enjoy coffee in! We really liked the chill surfer vibe of the neighborhood, plus it was really nice to come back here after a day of exploring San Francisco for a glass of wine and some ocean air. Walking on the beach in the morning and watching surfers out on the water was a real treat!! We were on the fence about staying this far from downtown San Francisco, but we're so glad we did. Transportation into the heart of the city is just a short train ride away, and even if you stick around the area, there is so much to explore. We can't wait to come back to San Francisco and stay here again!!! Thanks Heather!!",San Francisco,1
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"I have used many enjoyable Airbnb’s while traveling, but Tyler’s home has really raised the bar (my expectations will be way too high now!!). Traveling to a new city for a vacation, you want to find the best of everything so you enjoy your time...well...Tyler made our whole vacation so enjoyable!! I asked for several recommendations and he had a variety of options for anything I asked. He went above & beyond when I asked for wine country recommendations and gave me a whole layout of the area, and a list to follow for the day. He truly puts so much thought and care into his home. Staying at Tyler’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. The location is amazing, and has several bus stops nearby. The home is just as described, and the view is just as incredible as in the picture. The room...seriously exceeds all expectations. He has thought of EVERY detail...hair dryer, bath robes, coffee, phone chargers, white noise, a mini fridge, and snacks (other little things too , but those at the things that were really a “wow” factor for me!). He was also so generous and let us check in early after a flight that arrived before check in time. I am so glad I found Tyler’s home!!",San Francisco,1
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"We stayed at Tyler’s place for two nights before leaving for two nights for a Yosemite tour and then coming back for another 4 nights. Tyler was very accommodating and allowed us to store our luggage in his office and brought it down to the room on the day we returned. 

The place was absolutely beautiful with stunning views. Do expect to walk up a slope and climb stairs to get to the entrance and another flight to the room. 

The room was super cosy and had everything that we needed. Thoughtful touches included a nicely designed welcome magazine orienting you to the house, facilities and neighbourhood, providing snacks, drinks, ear plugs, white noise speaker and Apple TV.  He even replaced the beer in the fridge with Prosecco and Rosé after realising that we were drinking wine. 

The neighbourhood seems relatively safe and the cafe nearby is a great place to grab a meal and just chill. Do head over to the nearby Bernal Heights Park, hike up to the top for amazing 360 view of San Francisco and a cute swing on a tree!

Finally, Tyler was a great host who responded promptly to messages and was very accommodating. It was very comfortable chatting with him. 

We definitely recommend this place to anyone who doesn’t mind a little bit of climb to get to the house and also doesn’t mind staying outside the city. ",San Francisco,1
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"This is a phenomenal space that gives you a superb experience of luxury in the city.  Beginning with the electronic key box with a retractable (can’t lose it) key fitting in a well made glass and metal door, to the clever shoe rack and the polished wood floors taking you to your excellent, smartly appointed, compact private room and bath, you know right away that you are in a very fine home maintained by someone with impeccable, modern taste.  When you climb a few more stairs to enter the common living area shared with your host Tyler, you get a breathtaking view across the Mission to downtown a few miles away, as well as the hills climbing up to Noe Valley and beyond to Twin Peaks.  This modern “open space concept” area is done exactly right, and just as open space fans intend — with gracious sitting, eating/work areas, that wonderful aquarium, and an astounding assortment of their collection of interesting libations on glass shelves.  Your own room has two windows in  a 90 degree corner covering much of the same view, as well as an intimate glimpse into a typical SF backyard garden below (you are one story above the street, and on a steeply climbing hill, so you are looking out over the neighbors below on the hillside.  General city noise with the window open for ventilation was modest, and there is a tiny electronic white sound device if you need it.  Your room is beautifully arranged, with a very comfortable queen bed, and large TV with Apple TV to watch.  Plus complimentary beverages in the small fridge, a K-cup maker, snacks, device chargers, bathrobe, slippers, and many other thoughtful and elegant touches in the room and bath — you are in a private suite so to speak.  There was zero noise from within the building or other occupants.  The closet is large and generous to hold your suitcases, as this delightful room is more “pocket size” than the usual overly large hotel room; it’s more like an updated luxury room in an early 1900’s fancy city hotel (Algonquin in NYC, Benson in Portland, or a Westin packaged into a compact structure).  

Our only cautions for others in selecting this property are commonplace for SF hilly neighborhoods:  (1) it does involve at least a dozen stairs for carrying your luggage so make sure you can do that; and (2) if you are coming via car instead of taxi/shared ride service, do expect to hunt for parking that could be a five minute (and possibly) steep walk away in the neighborhood of often narrow streets, as this is in the aptly named Bernal Heights  — but as we said, those two cautions exist in most hilly SF neighborhoods (we lived in nearby Glen Park for 20 years).  Otherwise, you will surely be delighted by the experience and by Tyler’s detailed and generous hospitality.",San Francisco,1
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Staying at Tyler’s place was amazing ! It’s the best Airbnb we have had in these 21 days in America. Starting with the excellent communication with him pre and post our stay in answering and fulfilling my requests to his attention to all the small details provided in this stay. It’s definitely better than our stay in Hilton at downtown, especially safety wise and we get to have local experience in this warm and luxurious house that even the fussiest people will be pleased. Tyler has thought of everything a guest might want or need, providing a luxe, generous and comfortable place I.e phone charger ready for the guest, welcome snacks, a small fridge filled with local beer, big nice tv with Apple box to unwind at night, and good quality organic sf made lavender lotion and shampoos. There are so many beautiful places to see in SF and trust me, Tyler’s place will make your trip in SF even better ! ",San Francisco,1
Mission District Views from Private Floor with Attached Bath,"Tyler’s place was welcoming from the very beginning. Beautiful building to walk up to, stylish suite/home and setup, little welcome notes and interesting explanations scattered throughout our room and public spaces! It was fun to stay here. It was absolutely comfortable, clean, private, and gorgeous. The views from our window and the upstairs balcony were eye-popping and all of the accommodations and spaces were out of an interior design magazine! The bar areas and aquarium in the homeowner’s shared space were also quite impressive.

Communication was great and check-in was a breeze! We just rolled right in and came and went as we pleased without issue. Instructions for everything were easy to follow and refer back to!

There were sooo many thoughtful touches that really made this Airbnb EXTRA. A little snack kit, drinks to consider in the fridge, speaker hookups, smart lighting, ear plugs and tissues, commercial-free Hulu (haha!!), coffee station, wine bottle donation option, sweet WiFi, bathroom soaps and toiletries, slippers and robes... to even just leaving the light on for us each night so we could be welcomed home properly!!! Just so much thought went into creating the amazing guest experience here. And the walkthroughs and notes were all so clever. We also were able to find free parking each day within a few blocks of the place, which was great.

Location-wise, it’s great. You can walk to the Mission (we did) or to the main strip of restaurants on Cortland in Bernal Heights. You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area.

This is the BEST Airbnb we have ever stayed in - in the US and in the world. Lovely!! We really lucked out. We appreciate Tyler for giving this fun and memorable experience :)  what a gorgeous home.",San Francisco,1
"Private, Remodeled Home Close to Golden Gate Park","Whoever coined the phrase, “location, location, location” must have had Tyler’s place in mind.  Not only is it sparkling clean, this rental is stylishly appointed with a full sized stove, refrigerator, and oven which we found useful for heating up leftovers and making eggs in the morning.
Tyler’s place is conveniently located near the Land’s End Coastal Trail which for adventurous hikers will take you all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. The magnificent vistas you will see on your hike will make you forget you’re actually getting a great workout. Tyler’s place is also extremely close to the Golden Gate Park, the deYoung Museum, public transportation, and a wide variety of restaurants & supermarkets like Safeway on 48th & Fulton.  We especially loved that it was only a couple of streets away from Ocean Beach and the spectacular Sea Cliff bluffs.  We took regular walks along the coastline, and were happy to be able to come “home” in the evening to a place that was very comfortable and inviting.  In all, we had an amazing time, and would highly recommend his place to others.",San Francisco,1
Upscale Private Ensuite Bed & Bath,"Jeffrey and Mike are lovely hosts and the room we stayed in with a beautiful en suite bathroom was very comfortable, stylish and clean.  The room is in a beautiful San Francisco Victorian in the back of the house.  It has many of the hallmarks of this architecture, like the high ceilings and the ornate crown molding, and because it was located in the back of the house it was surprisingly quiet.  We slept really well!  The bathroom was also very updated, comfortable and gorgeous.  There was great water pressure, and while we noticed the large spa tub, we didn't have time to use it (besides, we're Californians who worry about water use!), but I'm sure it would be great!

The location is wonderful!  The Fillmore District is full of vibrant restaurants and bars, and beautiful boutiques on Fillmore Street, and the neighborhood has the most gorgeous homes you can imagine, mostly Victorian and Edwardian.  We strolled around the residential part of the neighborhood after dinner one night to see the Christmas lights and decorations.  It was stunningly pretty and very quiet and safe.  Everything was within walking distance or an easy Uber ride away.  This is definitely a fantastic get-away in the heart of one of the most beautiful and stylish neighborhoods in San Francisco!",San Francisco,1
Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"Pictures do not begin to show the beauty of this place. Such a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and wonderful apartment with incredible amenities. We literally didn’t need to worry about a thing! The private deck/ patio is nice but the swimming pool and hot tub are so awesome. The scenery around them is what makes it so relaxing. Nina and Merv really take pride in their property and are so generous. It was nice not needing to worry about packing beach towels, hair dryer, kitchen items or even toys! Having the puzzles and drawing books was fun as well. Thank you so much. We can’t wait to return!",Virginia Beach,1
Chesapeake 2-Bedroom Guest House,"We were traveling with our crawling 9-month-old and that’s always a little worrisome for a young mom, but Nina had the place so amazingly clean, it was fantastic. There is also a closet of toys for kids, covering a great age range. Some items my kiddo enjoyed, but things for older kids too. We were excited that the pool was still an option in early October, our little guy LOVED it, and we enjoyed it too, very brisk and refreshing temperature. The kitchen was stocked really well with cooking utensils, and some breakfast options were available, along with a great array of breakfast beverages. After dinner, we got our kiddo put to bed and took the baby monitor with us to relax in the hot tub. It was the perfect place to relax after a day of traveling! The bed was very comfortable. There was a crib and high chair available, we didn’t use them because we had our pack’n’play and travel booster chair, but I was impressed they had them. Wish we could have stayed more than one night! Great hosts, sweet dogs, beautiful neighborhood, we look forward to visiting again and will recommend to our friends and family whenever they’re in the area. Wonderful place!",Virginia Beach,1
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"I have had the privilege of being a guest at the Ocean Park Cottage for the past 3.5 months as I've been in Virginia Beach on a consulting engagement. I can't thank Tim and Chris enough for everything they did to make my stay there feel so much like home. The cottage is a cozy environment with a completely stocked kitchen; comfortable furniture; quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance to food, entertainment AND beautiful walking trails and the beach is one road crossing away! The hosts, Chris and Tim, do EVERYTHING they can to create the most welcoming experience. They provide special treats when checking in (or back-in, in my case); they share some great tips on the amazing restaurants nearby; Tim helped me navigate my first snow-driving experience with expert advise for a Californian with zero snow-driving experience! The week my husband came to visit, Tim spent time showing him around and the level of hospitality and true caring by both Tim and Chris can NOT be beat. If you are looking for a romantic get-away or the perfect beach location for a break - I highly recommend the Ocean Park Cottage.",Virginia Beach,1
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"My sister and I planned our trip to Ocean Park Cottage a couple months before visiting - Tim and Chris were SO helpful with offering suggestions on what we could do and see while we were in town.  The cottage was super cute and comfortable, and SO close to the beach.  We just had to walk across the street.  There are endless amounts of things to do and see within close proximity of the cottage.  We went hiking at First Landing State Park, went and saw the two old lighthouses close by (and also the site of the first landing), walked for miles along the beach, and ate at a few really good restaurants. We definitely want to come back - the town was charming and laid back.  Thanks to Chris and Tim for making the trip even better!",Virginia Beach,1
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"Wow, what can I say! Like all their other guests, I agree this home is spectacular for its location, privacy, comfort, and the most hospitable hosts. The garden is so peaceful and lovely in the morning where we had morning coffee. The local park/trails were explored daily and we even took the bikes out! The neighborhood is quiet with lots of people walking their dogs and saying hi to you. Tons of restaurants nearby and so many good options! Tim has endless suggestions for you to fully enjoy your time here. The kitchen is fully stocked, good for cooking your own meals. Huge closet space so you’re not living out of your suitcase. Clean bathroom/shower with water that stays hot. Lots of books that I wish I had time to read! Oh, and a speaker system so you can plug in your phone and play music. We loved that they had sidewalk chalk since my fiance is an artist. Wifi was consistent, No TV but we have a mini projector that we travel with...just for unwinding and watching a movie at the end of the night. There’s so many things to see and do or just relax so a TV isnt necessary! Thank you both for having us!",Virginia Beach,1
Ocean Park Cottage - Garden by Bay,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Chris and Tim's cottage.  We had the whole place to ourselves with free parking and access to all things beach going (towels, chairs, bikes, etc).  The cottage itself was decorated in a most beautiful and artistic way.  Just being inside and examining the decor was entertaining in of itself.  My husband and I travel a lot and I can say conclusively this was the most adorable place we have ever stayed in.  If you appreciate fine detail, this is the place to stay!  It was just a short walk to the beach, ecological preserve (hiking), and good restaurants. Virginia Beach proper is a 10 minute drive.  We found it pretty packed with tourist (albeit it was the 4th of July weekend) and felt the Atlantic beach and Chesapeake Bay beach looked the same.  We much preferred the Chesapeake Bay beach (almost no people) near Chris and Tim's cottage.  So happy we found this place!  Vicki and Rick - San Diego, CA",Virginia Beach,1
Ocean Retreat,"Melissa is nicest of hosts! From the moment I arrived It felt like I was staying at a friend’s house. We hit it off right away and even talked in kitchen for a while before I unloaded my car and got a tour of the house! Melissa have a Big heart and really loves others around her! She even took the time to write out a lengthy recommendation list based off my interest and her restaurant spots were out of this world!  Make sure that you make time to meet with her if possible before you go! She has an really inspiring story! :) I also got to meet her daughter who is home some of the time and she also has the sweetest of spirits!   It was a short trip but Visited the Beach, Boardwalk and The Navy seal monument which was pretty profound! I would highly recommend it if you have an opportunity located on 38th street and the boardwalk.   Hope to visit here again and thanks again Melissa, you Rock!",Virginia Beach,1
Private Backyard Oasis - 3 Blocks From the Beach!,"Wow!  Absolutely perfect!  My boyfriend and I needed a “down/relaxing” weekend.  We found it here.  This is away from the “hustle and bustle” of Virginia Beach, yet close enough to get to easily to enjoy.  Star and Austin have bikes, beach towels, beach chairs, a cooler, etc...everything you need to enjoy a get away to Virginia Beach.  We really enjoyed: Chapel pizza, Rockafellas, the Waterfront, Repeal Bourbon and Burgers, Chix’s, Bad Ass Coffee nd the Shack on 8th!  We also did a dolphin cruise through Ruddees.  The great thing, these were all within biking / walking distance of Star and Austin’s place.  This place is clean, spacious, the bed is so comfy and the place is quiet!  Just book it now!  You won’t be disappointed!",Virginia Beach,1
Private Secluded Studio a Stone's Throw from the Beach,"Christine's lovely place deserves every one of it's five star reviews.  I'll add mine to the list! The location is ideal. Her place is tucked away on a quiet street that backs to a golf course. You can't believe you are within walking distance to the boardwalk.   It is  close to everything. You can walk to a Harris Teter.  Everythingyou could need is within walking distance or a bike ride. Speakingof bikes, they are a great amenity. I'm not a big cyclist, but I took Christine's suggestion and biked along the  boardwalk.  With dedicated bike lanes, it is easy and fun.   Christine's dining recommendations were spot on. She put a lot of thought into finding quality eateries.. everything from coffee shops and greasy spoons, to seafood and Mexican. Added bonus.. almost every place is within walking distance.  The apartment itself is spotless and stylish. The mattress is very comfortable and she has every variety of pillow you can think of! You will sleep well. The kitchenette is adorable.. and I loved the window seat, which was a perfect reading nook. I can't wait to come back to Christine'sduringmy next trip to Virginia Beach.  If you don't want to be stuck in a high rise condo next to rowdy college kids, this is the place for you!",Virginia Beach,1
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"Man, it’s really hard to explain the amount of comfort, appreciation and hospitality that Brent provided. No exaggeration when I say I felt as if I were at home, didn’t have to ask for anything. Brent went above and beyond for me and my fiancé one of the most genuine and beautiful human beings I’ve met and it was an everlasting memory staying at his home that I will not forget. Brent should be a role model for all other hosts. You would be lucky to stay at a place like his so book it if you see it, no need to second guess. I can’t wait to go back believe me when I say this guy went above and beyond and it was second to none!",Virginia Beach,1
The CARRIAGE HOUSE on the Chesapeake Bay,"This place was perfect for our family of four. The sand is steps from the bottom of the stairs, and the beach is perhaps 30 steps from there, just over the dune. The beach isn't crowded at all--and the water is pretty calm and fairly shallow, great for younger kids. The apartment doesn't only have a great location, it was sparkling clean and had a great beach house vibe to it. Plenty of amenities provided, including all linens and beach towels. Brent was always responsive to any questions. Information provided some great recommendations for local places to eat at. There's also a outdoor shower to wash off all the sand, and a garden deck area to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or an evening read. We loved it!",Virginia Beach,1
"Walk Two Blocks To Beach, Private Entrance to Room","For the past 20 years we have camped at First Landing State Park, of which our favorite facet is the Cape Henry bike trail which spans from 64th street, through first Landing all the way to Jade st.  Katherine’s place is about 200 feet from this trail so we were smack dab in the middle of all of our favorite things. The bayside beach, First landing, our local friends and maybe best of all two amazing eateries that have a plethora of Vegan Options, Citrus and Sugar Shack Donuts.    This location pretty much offers it all and we found ourselves mostly just jumping on our bikes to grab a few groceries, a drink or a bite to eat.   The space was quiet, secluded and inviting. The bed and linens were over the top comfy and the bathroom and Kitchenette was stylish and updated.   We were surprised by the amenities offered such as teas, coffee, luxury toiletries, local guides and even a bidet!    Just the right amount of communication as well, accessible but private and Katherine is a terrific person we looked forward to talking with.   Beach living in a quiet, inviting setting. ",Virginia Beach,1
Waterfront Oasis,"What a gorgeous place!  The view in and of itself was soothing and visually interesting (enjoyed spying on a bald eagle, Canadian geese, great egrets, herons, and few smaller perching birds; the trees were also varied and impressively mature), but the interior was stylish and cozy as well (can't wait to see the upstairs!).  The location was convenient to both major highways and our friends, as well as grocery stores and plenty of restaurants.  Kara and Nick respectfully kept their distance (something my husband especially appreciated)--and our welcome included thoughtfully personalized touches--allowing us a thoroughly enjoyable vacation!  What an excellent find and opportunity!!!",Virginia Beach,1
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"If you thinking to go to this house don’t think twice it’s definitely a wonderful trip very entertaining for couples friends or families , it’s got it all , what makes this house more entertaining and Joyful is its owner Chuck, he was very respectful helpful and welcoming, he did his best to make our staying as successful as possible he was also nice to our kids who kept going to his office to play with his lovely dog Charlotte . Chuck gave us our privacy , we did not feel he was in the house at all but when we needed him he was like a Genie in a bottle.  We enjoyed spending our nights sitting next to the chimney facing the outstanding view looking at the lake. We also enjoyed barbecuing and eating on the big table which has another corner of the house with the another amazing sunset view , bedrooms warm and neatly done as well as the bathrooms , we will definitely consider going back to experience the summer with this house",Virginia Beach,1
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Chuck’s place is very special with amazing view, design touches and spaciousness. The guest rooms are good size with adjoining and fully renovated bathroom. Chuck is available and close by, yet you feel like you have the house alone. He is patient, warm, kind and shares the history of his home. Our child loved all the details, the swing outside, the popcorn machine and being greeted by Charlotte, the dog. I loved relaxing in the hot tub, robes provided, the chefs kitchen and cool lighting. I think our stay will be a sweet memory, not just lodging on a trip.",Virginia Beach,1
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"When I booked Wiseacre, I remember thinking that the price seemed surprisingly low, almost too good to be true. Then, once I'd committed, I noticed that we would be sharing the house with the owner. So that explains it! I had never done this before, and was a little concerned that it might be awkward. Turns out it was not awkward in the least! Chuck is a great guy - very friendly and interesting, but is never intrusive. And the home and grounds are spacious enough that we were never in each other's way. He works quietly in his office most of the time, but is readily available for a chat, advice, or a recommendation for food or something to do. The house is extremely close to the airport - which is convenient, but I wondered if the noise would be problematic (I'm a light sleeper and pretty sensitive to noise) - nope, you can hear the occasional plane but it isn't bothersome at all, and we slept very well. Being a fan of mid-century modern art, design, and architecture, I thoroughly enjoyed the home and all the interesting furnishings Chuck has curated. So big thumbs up for Wiseacre, for Chuck and for his sweet dog Charlotte.",Virginia Beach,1
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Well today is the last day of my 28 day stay at Wiseacre. I came here to Norfolk Virginia to hang out with my 4 grandchildren ages 13, 10, 6, and 5. I also worked as usual on during the days since they are in school all day long.  If you need to stay in Norfolk for any amount of time, I can say to you, ""Look no further than Wiseacre!"". Here are just a few reasons why... The owner, Chuck, is as kind, friendly and accommodating as you would want a host to be, and then some. The grounds are spectacular and vast with something to peek your interest at every turn. The home itself is so incredibly spectacular with the intent of Frank Lloyd Wrights' unique architecture of bringing the outside into the home.  Morning sunrise and evening sundown are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area.  The view spans past the wonderfully creativity of the land into the clear gorgeous Whitehurst Lake with birds bathing all day long and paddle fisherman enjoying their mornings on the weekends. Kayaking is also something to consider if you have time! Quality! Creativity! Gorgeous views! And, just as important to note - the friendliness of Chuck is real! So real, that I now have made a new friend and will visit here once per year - to see my family and to see Chuck again. Don't hesitate - the airport is only 6 minutes away. Restaurants around the corner, food marts and drug stores. Downtown is but a 15 minute rive, super easy. Definitely my go to for Norfolk. Happy stay to you!

Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"We had the pleasure of staying at Wiseacre for a few days to enjoy some peaceful family time.  Wiseacre is a beautiful, Frank Lloyd Wright inspired house filled with an eclectic array of art, history and personal touches.  Chuck and Charlotte (the sweetest pup) were the best hosts.  Chuck was very attentive and responsive to all of our questions, and also provided helpful tips to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable.  The house was sparkling clean, the bedrooms were comfortable and well appointed,  and the amenities were plentiful.  We used the full, modern kitchen to cook several meals--we had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay!  You can expect to enjoy incredible  art, lake views, stunning sunrises and sunsets, nature all around, and the moon peeking through the top of the massive living room windows at night...absolutely beautiful!  Wiseacre was so close to so many restaurants, stores, the beach, and other attractions.   It was so convenient to all of our little side adventures.  We even spent some time fishing on Lake Whitehurst which is located on the property. This was our first Airbnb experience and we think that Chuck, Charlotte, and Wiseacre have set the bar so very high!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would come back to visit in a heartbeat!  We had an amazing family getaway!  We highly recommend Wiseacre!",Virginia Beach,1
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Wiseacre is dripping in mid-century goodness, local history, beautiful art, and a generous host at its core.  We booked Chuck's home for 4 nights with 10 guests and we had plenty of elbow room!  Our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to  Chuck's experienced guidance.  He's a wealth of help at just the right moment!  His home is airy and warm, an uncommon juxtaposition.  My favorite activity was looking out the large floor-to-vaulted-ceiling windows watching the weather and lake activity.  It's easy to forget you're in the middle of Norfolk.  Lastly, Charlotte was a little love to have around!  Quiet, affectionate and the best of pups.  Thank you, Chuck and Charlotte, for providing your amazing home as a wedding venue.  We hope to see you again soon!",Virginia Beach,1
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"My family stayed at Chuck's spacious and funky home, Wiseacre, during my daughter's graduation weekend from Old Dominion University.  This mid-century modern gem and its gorgeous property provided the perfect setting for a post-graduation dinner which we hosted for family and friends.  Chuck was the epitome of an extraordinary host!  He was flexible with our arrangements and offered to assist us in every way possible before, during, and after our event.  All of our guests commented on this unique and stunning property which allowed both intimacy and plenty of space to spread out.  The accommodations were comfortable and we enjoyed the eye candy of lake views from the expansive living room windows.  The furnishings, artwork, and decor add to the charm and whimsy of Wiseacre.  Everywhere one turns there is something else to discover - many pieces provide a chuckle, as does Chuck himself (and his adorable Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Charlotte).  Chuck's sense of humor is delightful and we truly loved our chats with him throughout our stay.  We hope to visit again sometime and take in the beauty and whimsy of Wiseacre!  Thank you, Chuck, for a celebratory weekend my family and I will always remember! Cheers, Charlotte",Virginia Beach,1
Wiseacre MidCentury Lake Estate: Near Beach & Bay,"Chuck’s beautiful home and landscape is only matched by his own wonderful personality, we decided that we will be staying here from here on out whenever we visit Norfolk so long as the space is available when we do visit.   Most everything you can imagine is within a 15 minute drive with some great options for lunch/dinner at an even shorter distance. We were mostly decided on where to eat one day for lunch, but Chuck suggested this place specifically and we switched it up - needless to say it was great.   The home is photo-worthy and the landscape is worthy of the imagination of painters. The entire house is covered head to toe with a specific taste in art, it’s engaging. I just wish we had the time to ask about all the pieces.  All in all, this is one of the best trips I’ve ever had. Chuck is a fantastic host, with a gorgeous home rich in history; we couldn’t have been happier.",Virginia Beach,1
"Charming cute cabin, superhost","I had a little trepidation at first, I am not someone who knows Tacoma well and the direction I came from was not great. I pulled up to the cabin and saw a charming well-taken care of abode, with a grill out front and little hearts carved into the wood panels for the railing.  Do not shape your expectations that you are staying in a hotel, instead view this as your little family cabin or a family members. The place is clean and homey, with little amenities tucked everywhere but in a comfortable 'lived-in' style. I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the size, layout, and presentation.  One of the awesome cute touches they have are post-it notes everywhere, little paper signs that explain things in a sometimes funny manner. Reading about the age of the house, the light-switch coverings being made from old newspaper which used to be the first wallpaper of the house, the sidewalk to nowhere or even the helpful ""Knives here!"" ""First-aid!"" or ""More coffee in the freezer"" was very great.  There is a manual of 'rules' on the table and I was thinking that it was going to be one of 'those kind' but when I opened it - it really was a how-to guide on how to make yourself at home.  So I did. I started to get nosy and open everything and got loads of brilliant surprises, all sorts of games and fun things to find. Some of it completely unexpected (Geology? Electronics kits? Old powered Microscopes?) WHAT FUN! What nostalgia on the games! A *classic* leather-bound trivial pursuit  even!  The place was safe and secure, I didn't feel threatened on the streets or neighborhood. The driveway is a tiny bit cramped if you drive a behemoth, so be careful but the how-to guide explains this too ;-)  If you want to learn more, just stay!",Tacoma,1
"Aloha Tiny House, Dash Point","We had a great time staying in Dash Point at Tony and Attina's place. It was our first time in Tacoma. The view is what drew me to their place and when sun made an appearance sitting out on the deck and taking in the view was awesome. They have put much thought into their place and it showed. The home is as advertised and then some with fine detail with the guest(s) in mind. There were books to read, games, coloring books and videos for your use. They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. Take advantage of their guidebook recommendations.",Tacoma,1
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"Each June I travel from California to Tacoma to oversee a program at the University of Puget Sound. My stay is for three weeks. This is the fourth year I've stayed at Susan's Charming Proctor Suite. It has become my home away from home. The Suite has everything I could need and more, thanks to Susan. Thoughtful touches, like a ""welcome back"" bottle of wine and fresh flowers, a fresh-fruit basket, breakfast items in the refrigerator, fresh pastries - the list goes on. Susan goes out of her way to let me know of new restaurants, events and sites to see each time I visit. The neighborhood is beautiful. And, when I find free time I like to head out for a walk to look at the beautiful houses or shop at some of the quaint boutiques in the Proctor District.  I've already planned my return visit to the Charming Proctor Suite in 2020!!",Tacoma,1
Charming Proctor Suite in Tacoma’s North End,"For this trip, I was lucky to be able to book my husband and his brother in at my fave place in Tacoma.  My husband is a man of few words...and fewer superlatives.  But below is all him:  Our stay at Susan’s place was fantastic. She could not have been a more welcoming host. Not only was the space immaculate, she had left us a wonderful variety of fruits, baked goods, beverages and even small samples of local ice cream. There were also a variety of tour guides and local magazines to help us find good restaurants and attractions. Susan had also prepared her own short review of some of the local restaurants which was extremely helpful. The beds were very comfortable and the space otherwise provided everything we needed. Susan didn’t miss a detail.  Susan’s place is located in a great quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance of grocery stores, restaurants, pharmacies and the University of Puget Sound which is a beautiful campus. Though a bit longer, the Tacoma waterfront is walkable for those who can handle hills.  All in all, I would highly recommend Susan’s place as somewhere to stay if you are in the Tacoma area. One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had.  Thank you Susan !!",Tacoma,1
Creative Artist Loft in❤️of Tacoma,"I love the little notes that they have! By the mirror there’s a note that said “you’re beautiful”  they have the softest, coziest blankets ever! I cozied up in one with some tea watching Eternal Sunshine on the couch, my friend and my favorite movie ever! They have it! And they have coasters! My friends and I seriously wanted to buy their loft it’s so beautiful. I sent some of my friend’s the link and they loooooved it! So many compliments on the place! I love the earthy artsy vibe a ton. And at the price!!!  We drew, played guitar, watched shows, played pool, did our makeup in the mirror, took pictures, made coffee and tea, played games, listened to vinyls, etc we took advantage of all the place had to offer us! Brian and Hillary are so kind too! It was my first time renting an Airbnb so I was nervous if I was gonna do something wrong or something was gonna mess up but it was a wonderful experience! I had a slumber party here with my friends for my birthday last week. One of them slept in the hammock ❤️ and I’m 19 now :) So cozy and a lovely experience! I also forgot I left an unopened bagged salad in the fridge so the next people who show up have a salad they can eat! Other notes, idk how to set up the wii but it’s okay because I enjoyed tv instead. :) Thank you Brian and Hillary! ",Tacoma,1
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"Zeena and her husband, Howie, have a beautiful home and were very gracious hosts. My wife and I actually had just gotten married and were coming in fairly late from our reception. We communicated this via the message board and Zeena had no problem with the late check-in. Her directions to the house were very clear and it was easy to find in the dark. When we rolled up to the front door, Zeena was very welcoming, happy, and energetic in her greeting. She took the time to give us a little tour of the house even though we were only staying one night. Before saying good night, she even double checked our dietary preferences and was more than happy to cater to our vegetarian diets. The room was so cozy and spotless! They had a good spread of trail mix, granola bars, and kettle corn along with bottles of water on ice. They don't have air conditioning, but the room temperature in the middle of summer was more than tolerable with the ceiling fan and open window. We had a great night's sleep and was impressed with the high quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the bathtub. For breakfast, Zeena laid out a wonderful meal complete with eggs, cinnamon toast, fresh fruit and coffee. Zeena checked in with us regularly and always asked if we needed anything else, definitely going above and beyond. Even though our stay was short, my new wife and I were extremely satisfied and delighted with our stay at Zeena and Howie's home! However, one of our favorite parts of their home was their dog, Samantha, who was so cute and loving! We would recommend this to anybody looking for a comfortable and clean room, kind hosts, a great meal, and a very adorable dog!",Tacoma,1
Home away from home -Cottage Style Bed & Breakfast,"Zeena is a gracious host and has a lovely home to stay in, with a convenient location close to the sights around Gig Harbor. She has an eye for details and takes care of extra touches to insure that her guests are comfortable and pampered. The gourmet breakfasts are simply delicious, with organic tea served hot (the way I love it), fresh squeezed orange juice and wonderful dishes like steel cut oatmeal with baked apples or yummy egg scrambles with sides. The bed is very comfortable, with lovely, high end sheets to sink into. All in all, we enjoyed a truly wonderful stay and highly recommend Zeena's home!",Tacoma,1
VIEW Cottage 3beds/2bath - sleeps 8,"Loved the views, truly beautiful from every room and either deck. Jerry and Julie were extremely accommodating and wonderful to work with. Great selection of games to play. Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. I love sleeping under the stars and waking up to the ships on the water. This home will not disappoint. Kitchen has a double oven as well as a microwave and a nice BBQ on the deck. Towels were super soft and big. All the beds were very comfortable and the Xtra air mattress was top notch. Loved the art and pictures. Loved drinking my coffee with the humming birds and watching the boats on the water. If you are not familiar with the area they have put together a great information manual to help out. The local grocery store down the road is great, good selection even though it is smaller than the large chains. It had everything I needed.",Tacoma,1
VIEW Cottage 3beds/2bath - sleeps 8,"Talk about finding a great house for a family gathering! Wow.... we loved this place! My husband and I traveled to the area to visit our son who is on assignment in Tacoma. Our daughter and her boyfriend came up from LA to join us. This house is away from the hustle/bustle of the Seattle area, yet convenient to Seatac airport and both cities. The three sleeping areas each had very comfortable beds, good pillows, and plenty of blankets of varying weights. Each bathroom was large with large, fluffy towels, shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash. The skylight over the king bed in the master bedroom provided a view of the night sky. I even saw two shooting stars at 4am the morning of our departure! The kitchen is nicely appointed, there are plenty of games and movies available, and there is even a great outdoor living space! And the views - beautiful!! I love waking up to the water and mountain views!  Although I have heard rumors that it always rains in Seattle, we had perfect weather this past week. Thanks, Jerry and Julie; your house was pretty much perfect!",Tacoma,1
Theater District Loft,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Denise's loft is gorgeous and very spacious.  Filled with art & comfy furniture.  Sophisticated yet very homey.  Denise has all of the amenities including wifi and some online/demand TV options.  Lovely modern kitchen with everything we needed. Truly nice spot.   The location near Opera Alley is fantastic for exploring Tacoma.  Great food & drinks & several theaters within 3 blocks in any direction.  The neighborhood is on the upswing and there are so many cool antique shops and small businesses everywhere. Very friendly folks. UW TACOMA & the museums are about a 20 min walk away.   We intended to hang out at the new McMenamins but spent most of our time at Denise's suggestions Red Star Tacos  & The Devil's Reef (a hopping tiki bar with BIG + unique drinks). We also hit a new spot called Wooden City on Pacific (GOOD FOOD & friendly service) and HONEY COFFEE at Alma Mater for breakfast (they had super yum meat, veg & vegan options + pastries and really good coffee). Eating in Tacoma is good these days.   Looking forward to visiting again. THANKS DENISE!  We had a FAB weekend.",Tacoma,1
